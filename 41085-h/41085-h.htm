<h2>
<i>PREFATORY NOTE</i>
</h2>

<p>
Dante Gabriel Rossetti, being the
son of an Italian who was greatly immersed
in the study of Dante Alighieri, and
who produced a Comment on the <i>Inferno</i>, and
other books relating to Dantesque literature, was
from his earliest childhood familiar with the
name of the stupendous Florentine, and to some
extent aware of the range and quality of his
writings. Nevertheless—or perhaps indeed it
may have been partly on that very account—he
did not in those opening years read Dante to any
degree worth mentioning: he was well versed in
Shakespeare, Walter Scott, Byron, and some other
writers, years before he applied himself to Dante.
He may have been fourteen years of age, or even
fifteen (May 1843), before he took seriously to
the author of the <i>Divina Commedia</i>. He then read
him eagerly, and with the profoundest admiration
and delight; and from the <i>Commedia</i> he proceeded
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>to the lyrical poems and the <i>Vita Nuova</i>. I
question whether he ever read—unless in the
most cursory way—other and less fascinating
writings of Alighieri, such as the <i>Convito</i> and the
<i>De Monarchiâ</i>.
</p>

<p>
From reading, Rossetti went on to translating.
He translated at an early age, chiefly between
1845 and 1849, a great number of poems by the
Italians contemporary with Dante, or preceding
him; and, among other things, he made a version
of the whole <i>Vita Nuova</i>, prose and verse. This
may possibly have been the first important thing
that he translated from the Italian: if not the
first, still less was it the last, and it may well be
that his rendering of the book was completed
within the year 1846, or early in 1847. He did
not, of course, leave his version exactly as it had
come at first: on the contrary, he took counsel
with friends (Alfred Tennyson among the number),
toned down crudities and juvenilities, and worked
to make the whole thing impressive and artistic—for
in such matters he was much more chargeable
with over-fastidiousness than with laxity. Still,
the work, as we now have it, is essentially the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>work of those adolescent years—from time to time
reconsidered and improved, but not transmuted.
</p>

<p>
Some few years after producing his translation
of the <i>Vita Nuova</i>, Rossetti was desirous of
publishing it, and of illustrating the volume
with etchings from various designs, which he had
meanwhile done, of incidents in the story. This
project, however, had to be laid aside, owing to
want of means, and the etchings were never undertaken.
It was only in 1861 that the volume named
<i>The Early Italian Poets</i>, including the translated
<i>Vita Nuova</i>, was brought out: the same volume,
with a change in the arrangement of its contents,
was reissued in 1874, entitled <i>Dante and his
Circle</i>. This book, in its original form, was received
with favour, and settled the claim of Rossetti to
rank as a poetic translator, or indeed as a poet
in his own right.
</p>

<p>
For <i>The Early Italian Poets</i> he wrote a Preface,
from which a passage, immediately relating to the
<i>Vita Nuova</i>, is extracted in the present edition.
There are some other passages, affecting the whole
of the translations in that volume, which deserve
to be borne in mind, as showing the spirit in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>which he undertook the translating work, and I
give them here:—
</p>

<p>
“The life-blood of rhythmical translation is this
commandment—that a good poem shall not be
turned into a bad one. The only true motive for
putting poetry into a fresh language must be to
endow a fresh nation, as far as possible, with one
more possession of beauty. Poetry not being an
exact science, literality of rendering is altogether
secondary to this chief law. I say <i>literality</i>,—not
fidelity, which is by no means the same thing.
When literality can be combined with what is thus
the primary condition of success, the translator is
fortunate, and must strive his utmost to unite
them; when such object can only be obtained by
paraphrase, that is his only path. Any merit possessed
by these translations is derived from an
effort to follow this principle.... The task of the
translator (and with all humility be it spoken) is
one of some self-denial. Often would he avail
himself of any special grace of his own idiom and
epoch, if only his will belonged to him: often
would some cadence serve him but for his author’s
structure—some structure but for his author’s
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>cadence: often the beautiful turn of a stanza must
be weakened to adopt some rhyme which will tally,
and he sees the poet revelling in abundance of
language where himself is scantily supplied. Now
he would slight the matter for the music, and now
the music for the matter; but no, he must deal
to each alike. Sometimes too a flaw in the work
galls him, and he would fain remove it, doing for
the poet that which his age denied him; but no,
it is not in the bond.”
</p>

<p>
It may be as well to explain here a very small
share which I myself took in the <i>Vita Nuova</i> translation.
When the volume <i>The Early Italian
Poets</i> was in preparation, my brother asked me
(January 1861) to aid by “collating my <i>Vita
Nuova</i> with the original, and amending inaccuracies.”
He defined the work further as follows:
“What I want is that you should correct my
translation throughout, removing inaccuracies and
mannerisms. And, if you have time, it would be
a great service to translate the analyses of the
poems (which I omitted). This, however, if you
think it desirable to include them. I did not at the
time (on ground of readableness), but since think
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>they may be desirable: only have become so unfamiliar
with the book that I have no distinct
opinion.” On January 25th he wrote: “Many
and many thanks for a most essential service most
thoroughly performed. I have not yet verified
the whole of the notes, but I see they are just
what I needed, and will save me a vast amount
of trouble. I should very much wish that the
translation were more literal, but cannot do it all
again. <i>My</i> notes, which you have taken the
trouble of revising, are, of course, quite paltry and
useless.”
</p>

<p>
In order that the reader may judge as to this
question of literality, I will give here the literal
Englishing of the Sonnet at p. 38, and the paragraph
which precedes it (I take the passage quite
at random), and the reader can, if he likes, compare
this rendering with that which appears in
Dante Rossetti’s text:—
</p>

<p>
“After the departure of this gentlewoman it was
the pleasure of the Lord of the Angels to call to
His glory a lady young and much of noble<a class="tag" id="tag1" href="#note1">[1]</a> aspect,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>who was very graceful in this aforesaid city: whose
body I saw lying without the soul amid many
ladies, who were weeping very piteously. Then,
remembering that erewhile I had seen her keeping
company with that most noble one, I could not
withhold some tears. Indeed, weeping, I purposed
to speak certain words about her death, in guerdon
of my having at some whiles seen her with my
lady. And somewhat of this I referred to in the
last part of the words which I spoke of her, as
manifestly appears to him who understands them:
and then I composed these two Sonnets—of which
the first begins, ‘Weep, lovers’—the second,
‘Villain Death.’
</p>

<p>
“Weep, lovers, since Love weeps,—hearkening
what cause makes him wail: Love hears ladies
invoking pity, showing bitter grief outwardly by
the eyes; because villain Death has set his cruel
working upon a noble heart, ruining that which in
a noble lady is to be praised in the world, apart
from honour. Hear how much Love did her
honouring; for I saw him lamenting in very
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>person over the dead seemly image: and often he
gazed towards heaven, wherein was already settled
the noble soul who had been a lady of such gladsome
semblance.”
</p>

<p>
It would be out of place to enter here into any
detailed observations upon the <i>Vita Nuova</i>, its
meaning, and the literature which has grown out
of it. I will merely name, as obvious things for
the English reader to consult, the translation which
was made by Sir Theodore Martin; the essay by
Professor C. Eliot Norton; the translations published
by Dr. Garnett in his book entitled <i>Dante,
Petrarch, Camoens, 124 Sonnets</i>, along with the
remarks in his valuable <i>History of Italian Literature</i>;
Scartazzini’s <i>Companion to Dante</i>; and the
publications of the Rev. Dr. Moore, the foremost
of our living Dante scholars.

<h2>
<i>INTRODUCTION.</i>
</h2>

<p>
The <i>Vita Nuova</i> (the Autobiography or Autopsychology
of Dante’s youth till about his
twenty-seventh year) is already well known to many
in the original, or by means of essays and of English
versions partial or entire. It is therefore, and on all
accounts, unnecessary to say much more of the work
here than it says for itself. Wedded to its exquisite
and intimate beauties are personal peculiarities which
excite wonder and conjecture, best replied to in the
words which Beatrice herself is made to utter in
the <i>Commedia</i>: “Questi <i>fù tal</i> nella sua vita nuova.”<a class="tag" id="tag2" href="#note2">[2]</a>
Thus then young Dante <i>was</i>. All that seemed
possible to be done here for the work was to translate
it in as free and clear a form as was consistent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>with fidelity to its meaning; and to ease it, as far
as possible, from notes and encumbrances.
</p>

<p>
It may be noted here how necessary a knowledge
of the <i>Vita Nuova</i> is to the full comprehension of
the part borne by Beatrice in the <i>Commedia</i>. Moreover,
it is only from the perusal of its earliest and
then undivulged self-communings that we can
divine the whole bitterness of wrong to such a
soul as Dante’s, its poignant sense of abandonment,
or its deep and jealous refuge in memory. Above
all, it is here that we find the first manifestations
of that wisdom of obedience, that natural breath
of duty, which afterwards, in the <i>Commedia</i>, lifted
up a mighty voice for warning and testimony.
Throughout the <i>Vita Nuova</i> there is a strain like
the first falling murmur which reaches the ear
in some remote meadow, and prepares us to look
upon the sea.
</p>

<p>
Boccaccio, in his Life of Dante, tells us that the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>great poet, in later life, was ashamed of this work
of his youth. Such a statement hardly seems
reconcilable with the allusions to it made or implied
in the <i>Commedia</i>; but it is true that the <i>Vita Nuova</i>
is a book which only youth could have produced,
and which must chiefly remain sacred to the young;
to each of whom the figure of Beatrice, less lifelike
than lovelike, will seem the friend of his own heart.
Nor is this, perhaps, its least praise. To tax its
author with effeminacy on account of the extreme
sensitiveness evinced by this narrative of his love,
would be manifestly unjust, when we find that,
though love alone is the theme of the <i>Vita Nuova</i>,
war already ranked among its author’s experiences
at the period to which it relates. In the year 1289,
the one preceding the death of Beatrice, Dante
served with the foremost cavalry in the great
battle of Campaldino, on the eleventh of June,
when the Florentines defeated the people of Arezzo.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>In the autumn of the next year, 1290, when for
him, by the death of Beatrice, the city as he says
“sat solitary,” such refuge as he might find from
his grief was sought in action and danger: for we
learn from the <i>Commedia</i> (Hell, C. xxi.) that
he served in the war then waged by Florence upon
Pisa, and was present at the surrender of Caprona.
He says, using the reminiscence to give life to a
description, in his great way:—
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>
“I’ve seen the troops out of Caprona go
</p>
<p class="i2">
  On terms, affrighted thus, when on the spot
</p>
<p>
They found themselves with foemen compass’d so.”
</p>

<p class="indr">
(<span class="smcap">Cayley’s</span> <i>Translation</i>.)
</p>

<p>
A word should be said here of the title of Dante’s
autobiography. The adjective <i>Nuovo</i>, <i>nuova</i>, or
<i>Novello</i>, <i>novella</i>, literally <i>New</i>, is often used by
Dante and other early writers in the sense of
<i>young</i>. This has induced some editors of the
<i>Vita Nuova</i> to explain the title as meaning
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span><i>Early Life</i>. I should be glad on some accounts
to adopt this supposition, as everything is a gain
which increases clearness to the modern reader; but
on consideration I think the more mystical interpretation
of the words, as <i>New Life</i> (in reference
to that revulsion of his being which Dante so
minutely describes as having occurred simultaneously
with his first sight of Beatrice), appears the primary
one, and therefore the most necessary to be given
in a translation. The probability may be that both
were meant, but this I cannot convey.<a class="tag" id="tag3" href="#note3">[3]</a>

THE NEW LIFE.<br />

<span class="x-small">(LA VITA NUOVA.)</span>

</h2>

<p>
In that part of the book of my memory before
the which is little that can be read, there is
a rubric, saying, <i>Incipit Vita Nova</i>.<a class="tag" id="tag4" href="#note4">[4]</a> Under such
rubric I find written many things; and among
them the words which I purpose to copy into
this little book; if not all of them, at the least
their substance.
</p>

<p>
Nine times already since my birth had the heaven
of light returned to the selfsame point almost, as concerns
its own revolution, when first the glorious Lady
of my mind was made manifest to mine eyes; even
she who was called Beatrice by many who knew
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>not wherefore.<a class="tag" id="tag5" href="#note5">[5]</a> She had already been in this life
for so long as that, within her time, the starry heaven
had moved towards the Eastern quarter one of the
twelve parts of a degree; so that she appeared to
me at the beginning of her ninth year almost, and I
saw her almost at the end of my ninth year. Her
dress, on that day, was of a most noble colour, a
subdued and goodly crimson, girdled and adorned
in such sort as best suited with her very tender age.
At that moment, I say most truly that the spirit of
life, which hath its dwelling in the secretest chamber
of the heart, began to tremble so violently that the
least pulses of my body shook therewith; and in
trembling it said these words: <i>Ecce deus fortior me,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>qui veniens dominabitur mihi.</i><a class="tag" id="tag6" href="#note6">[6]</a> At that moment the
animate spirit, which dwelleth in the lofty chamber
whither all the senses carry their perceptions, was
filled with wonder, and speaking more especially
unto the spirits of the eyes, said these words:
<i>Apparuit jam beatitudo vestra.</i><a class="tag" id="tag7" href="#note7">[7]</a> At that moment
the natural spirit, which dwelleth there where our
nourishment is administered, began to weep, and
in weeping said these words: <i>Heu miser! quia
frequenter impeditus ero deinceps.</i><a class="tag" id="tag8" href="#note8">[8]</a>
</p>

<p>
I say that, from that time forward, Love quite
governed my soul; which was immediately espoused
to him, and with so safe and undisputed a lordship
(by virtue of strong imagination) that I had nothing
left for it but to do all his bidding continually. He
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>oftentimes commanded me to seek if I might see
this youngest of the Angels: wherefore I in my
boyhood often went in search of her, and found her
so noble and praiseworthy that certainly of her might
have been said those words of the poet Homer,
“She seemed not to be the daughter of a mortal
man, but of God.”<a class="tag" id="tag9" href="#note9">[9]</a> And albeit her image, that was
with me always, was an exultation of Love to subdue
me, it was yet of so perfect a quality that it never
allowed me to be overruled by Love without the
faithful counsel of reason, whensoever such counsel
was useful to be heard. But seeing that were I
to dwell overmuch on the passions and doings of
such early youth, my words might be counted something
fabulous, I will therefore put them aside; and
passing many things that may be conceived by the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>pattern of these, I will come to such as are writ in
my memory with a better distinctness.
</p>

<p>
After the lapse of so many days that nine years
exactly were completed since the above-written
appearance of this most gracious being, on the last
of those days it happened that the same wonderful
lady appeared to me dressed all in pure white,
between two gentle ladies elder than she. And
passing through a street, she turned her eyes thither
where I stood sorely abashed: and by her unspeakable
courtesy, which is now guerdoned in the Great
Cycle, she saluted me with so virtuous a bearing that
I seemed then and there to behold the very limits
of blessedness. The hour of her most sweet salutation
was exactly the ninth of that day; and because
it was the first time that any words from her reached
mine ears, I came into such sweetness that I parted
thence as one intoxicated. And betaking me to the
loneliness of mine own room, I fell to thinking of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>this most courteous lady, thinking of whom I was
overtaken by a pleasant slumber, wherein a marvellous
vision was presented to me: for there appeared to
be in my room a mist of the colour of fire, within
the which I discerned the figure of a lord of terrible
aspect to such as should gaze upon him, but who
seemed therewithal to rejoice inwardly that it was
a marvel to see. Speaking he said many things,
among the which I could understand but few; and
of these, this: <i>Ego dominus tuus.</i><a class="tag" id="tag10" href="#note10">[10]</a> In his arms it
seemed to me that a person was sleeping, covered
only with a blood-coloured cloth; upon whom looking
very attentively, I knew that it was the lady of
the salutation who had deigned the day before to
salute me. And he who held her held also in his
hand a thing that was burning in flames; and he
said to me, <i>Vide cor tuum</i>.<a class="tag" id="tag11" href="#note11">[11]</a> But when he had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>remained with me a little while, I thought that he
set himself to awaken her that slept; after the which
he made her to eat that thing which flamed in his
hand; and she ate as one fearing. Then, having
waited again a space, all his joy was turned into
most bitter weeping; and as he wept he gathered
the lady into his arms, and it seemed to me that
he went with her up towards heaven: whereby such
a great anguish came upon me that my light slumber
could not endure through it, but was suddenly
broken. And immediately having considered, I knew
that the hour wherein this vision had been made
manifest to me was the fourth hour (which is to say,
the first of the nine last hours) of the night.
</p>

<p>
Then, musing on what I had seen, I proposed to
relate the same to many poets who were famous in
that day: and for that I had myself in some sort
the art of discoursing with rhyme, I resolved on
making a sonnet, in the which, having saluted all
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>such as are subject unto Love, and entreated them
to expound my vision, I should write unto them
those things which I had seen in my sleep. And
the sonnet I made was this:—
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>
To every heart which the sweet pain doth move,
</p>
<p class="i2">
  And unto which these words may now be brought
</p>
<p class="i2">
  For true interpretation and kind thought,
</p>
<p>
Be greeting in our Lord’s name, which is Love.
</p>
<p>
Of those long hours wherein the stars, above,
</p>
<p class="i2">
  Wake and keep watch, the third was almost nought,
</p>
<p class="i2">
  When Love was shown me with such terrors fraught
</p>
<p>
As may not carelessly be spoken of.
</p>
<p>
He seemed like one who is full of joy, and had
</p>
<p class="i2">
  My heart within his hand, and on his arm
</p>
<p class="i4">
    My lady, with a mantle round her, slept;
</p>
<p>
Whom (having wakened her) anon he made
</p>
<p class="i2">
  To eat that heart; she ate, as fearing harm.
</p>
<p class="i4">
    Then he went out; and as he went, he wept.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
<i>This sonnet is divided into two parts. In the first
part I give greeting, and ask an answer; in the
second, I signify what thing has to be answered to.
The second part commences here: “Of those long
hours.”</i>
</p>

<p>
To this sonnet I received many answers, conveying
many different opinions; of the which one was
sent by him whom I now call the first among my
friends, and it began thus, “Unto my thinking thou
beheld’st all worth.”<a class="tag" id="tag12" href="#note12">[12]</a> And indeed, it was when he
learned that I was he who had sent those rhymes
to him, that our friendship commenced. But the
true meaning of that vision was not then perceived
by any one, though it be now evident to the least
skilful.
</p>

<p>
From that night forth, the natural functions of my
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>body began to be vexed and impeded, for I was given
up wholly to thinking of this most gracious creature:
whereby in short space I became so weak and so
reduced that it was irksome to many of my friends
to look upon me; while others, being moved by
spite, went about to discover what it was my wish
should be concealed. Wherefore I (perceiving the
drift of their unkindly questions), by Love’s will,
who directed me according to the counsels of reason,
told them how it was Love himself who had thus
dealt with me: and I said so, because the thing was
so plainly to be discerned in my countenance
that there was no longer any means of concealing
it. But when they went on to ask, “And by
whose help hath Love done this?” I looked
in their faces smiling, and spake no word in
return.
</p>

<p>
Now it fell on a day, that this most gracious
creature was sitting where words were to be heard
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>of the Queen of Glory;<a class="tag" id="tag13" href="#note13">[13]</a> and I was in a place
whence mine eyes could behold their beatitude:
and betwixt her and me, in a direct line, there
sat another lady of a pleasant favour; who looked
round at me many times, marvelling at my continued
gaze which seemed to have <i>her</i> for its object.
And many perceived that she thus looked; so that
departing thence, I heard it whispered after me,
“Look you to what a pass <i>such a lady</i> hath brought
him;” and in saying this they named her who
had been midway between the most gentle Beatrice
and mine eyes. Therefore I was reassured, and
knew that for that day my secret had not become
manifest. Then immediately it came into my
mind that I might make use of this lady as a
screen to the truth: and so well did I play my part
that the most of those who had hitherto watched and
wondered at me, now imagined they had found
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>me out. By her means I kept my secret concealed
till some years were gone over; and for my better
security, I even made divers rhymes in her honour;
whereof I shall here write only as much as
concerneth the most gentle Beatrice, which is but
a very little. Moreover, about the same time while
this lady was a screen for so much love on my
part, I took the resolution to set down the name
of this most gracious creature accompanied with
many other women’s names, and especially with
hers whom I spake of. And to this end I put
together the names of sixty of the most beautiful
ladies in that city where God had placed mine
own lady; and these names I introduced in an
epistle in the form of a <i>sirvent</i>, which it is not
my intention to transcribe here. Neither should I
have said anything of this matter, did I not wish
to take note of a certain strange thing, to wit:
that having written the list, I found my lady’s
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>name would not stand otherwise than ninth in order
among the names of these ladies.
</p>

<p>
Now it so chanced with her by whose means
I had thus long time concealed my desire, that it
behoved her to leave the city I speak of, and to
journey afar: wherefore I, being sorely perplexed
at the loss of so excellent a defence, had more
trouble than even I could before have supposed.
And thinking that if I spoke not somewhat mournfully
of her departure, my former counterfeiting
would be the more quickly perceived, I determined
that I would make a grievous sonnet<a class="tag" id="tag14" href="#note14">[14]</a> thereof;
the which I will write here, because it hath certain
words in it whereof my lady was the immediate
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>cause, as will be plain to him that understands.
</p>

<p>
And the sonnet was this:—
</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
All ye that pass along Love’s trodden way,
</p>
<p>
Pause ye awhile and say
</p>
<p class="i2">
  If there be any grief like unto mine:
</p>
<p>
I pray you that you hearken a short space
</p>
<p>
Patiently, if my case
</p>
<p class="i2">
  Be not a piteous marvel and a sign.
</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>
Love (never, certes, for my worthless part,
</p>
<p>
But of his own great heart,)
</p>
<p class="i2">
  Vouchsafed to me a life so calm and sweet
</p>
<p>
That oft I heard folk question as I went
</p>
<p>
What such great gladness meant:—
</p>
<p class="i2">
  They spoke of it behind me in the street.
</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>
But now that fearless bearing is all gone
</p>
<p class="i2">
  Which with Love’s hoarded wealth was given me;
</p>
<p class="i2">
  Till I am grown to be
</p>
<p>
So poor that I have dread to think thereon.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
And thus it is that I, being like as one
</p>
<p class="i2">
  Who is ashamed and hides his poverty,
</p>
<p class="i2">
  Without seem full of glee,
</p>
<p>
And let my heart within travail and moan.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
<i>This poem has two principal parts; for, in the
first, I mean to call the Faithful of Love in those
words of Jeremias the Prophet</i>, “O vos omnes qui
transitis per viam, attendite et videte si est dolor
sicut dolor meus,” <i>and to pray them to stay and hear
me. In the second I tell where Love had placed
me, with a meaning other than that which the
last part of the poem shows, and I say what I
have lost. The second part begins here, “Love,
(never, certes).”</i>
</p>

<p>
A certain while after the departure of that lady,
it pleased the Master of the Angels to call into
His glory a damsel, young and of a gentle
presence, who had been very lovely in the city
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>I speak of: and I saw her body lying without
its soul among many ladies, who held a pitiful
weeping. Whereupon, remembering that I had seen
her in the company of excellent Beatrice, I could
not hinder myself from a few tears; and weeping,
I conceived to say somewhat of her death, in
guerdon of having seen her somewhile with my
lady; which thing I spake of in the latter end
of the verses that I writ in this matter, as he
will discern who understands. And I wrote two
sonnets, which are these:—
</p>

<p class="center large">
I.
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>
Weep, Lovers, sith Love’s very self doth weep,
</p>
<p class="i2">
  And sith the cause for weeping is so great;
</p>
<p class="i2">
  When now so many dames, of such estate
</p>
<p>
In worth, show with their eyes a grief so deep:
</p>
<p>
For Death the churl has laid his leaden sleep
</p>
<p class="i2">
  Upon a damsel who was fair of late,
</p>
<p class="i2">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
  Defacing all our earth should celebrate,—
</p>
<p>
Yea all save virtue, which the soul doth keep.
</p>
<p>
Now hearken how much Love did honour her.
</p>
<p class="i2">
  I myself saw him in his proper form
</p>
<p class="i4">
    Bending above the motionless sweet dead,
</p>
<p>
And often gazing into Heaven; for there
</p>
<p class="i2">
  The soul now sits which when her life was warm
</p>
<p class="i4">
    Dwelt with the joyful beauty that is fled.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>This first sonnet is divided into three parts. In
the first, I call and beseech the Faithful of Love to
weep; and I say that their Lord weeps, and that
they, hearing the reason why he weeps, shall be more
minded to listen to me. In the second, I relate this
reason. In the third, I speak of honour done by
Love to this Lady. The second part begins here,
“When now so many dames;” the third here, “Now
hearken.”</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
</p>

<p class="center large">
II.
</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Death, alway cruel, Pity’s foe in chief,
</p>
<p>
Mother who brought forth grief,
</p>

<p class="i2">
  Since thou alone hast made my heart to feel

<p>
<i>This poem is divided into four parts. In the first
I address Death by certain proper names of hers.
In the second, speaking to her, I tell the reason why
I am moved to denounce her. In the third, I rail
against her. In the fourth, I turn to speak to a
person undefined, although defined in my own conception.
The second part commences here, “Since
thou alone;” the third here, “And now (for I
must);” the fourth here, “Whoso deserves not.”</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
Some days after the death of this lady, I had occasion
to leave the city I speak of, and to go thitherwards
where she abode who had formerly been my
protection; albeit the end of my journey reached
not altogether so far. And notwithstanding that I
was visibly in the company of many, the journey
was so irksome that I had scarcely sighing enough
to ease my heart’s heaviness; seeing that as I
went, I left my beatitude behind me. Wherefore
it came to pass that he who ruled me by virtue of
my most gentle lady was made visible to my mind,
in the light habit of a traveller, coarsely fashioned.
He appeared to me troubled, and looked always on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>the ground; saving only that sometimes his eyes
were turned towards a river which was clear and
rapid, and which flowed along the path I was
taking. And then I thought that Love called me
and said to me these words: “I come from that
lady who was so long thy surety; for the matter
of whose return, I know that it may not be.
Wherefore I have taken that heart which I made
thee leave with her, and do bear it unto another
lady, who, as she was, shall be thy surety;” (and
when he named her I knew her well). “And of
these words I have spoken, if thou shouldst speak
any again, let it be in such sort as that none shall
perceive thereby that thy love was feigned for her,
which thou must now feign for another.” And
when he had spoken thus, all my imagining was
gone suddenly, for it seemed to me that Love
became a part of myself: so that, changed as it
were in mine aspect, I rode on full of thought the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>whole of that day, and with heavy sighing. And
the day being over, I wrote this sonnet:—
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>
A day agone, as I rode sullenly
</p>
<p class="i2">
  Upon a certain path that liked me not,
</p>
<p class="i2">
  I met Love midway while the air was hot,
</p>
<p>
Clothed lightly as a wayfarer might be.
</p>
<p>
And for the cheer he showed, he seemed to me
</p>
<p class="i2">
  As one who hath lost lordship he had got;
</p>
<p class="i2">
  Advancing tow’rds me full of sorrowful thought,
</p>
<p>
Bowing his forehead so that none should see.
</p>
<p>
Then as I went, he called me by my name,
</p>
<p class="i2">
  Saying: “I journey since the morn was dim
</p>
<p class="i4">
    Thence where I made thy heart to be: which now
</p>
<p>
I needs must bear unto another dame.”
</p>
<p class="i2">
  Wherewith so much passed into me of him
</p>
<p class="i4">
    That he was gone, and I discerned not how.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>This sonnet has three parts. In the first part,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>I tell how I met Love, and of his aspect. In the
second, I tell what he said to me, although not in
full, through the fear I had of discovering my secret.
In the third, I say how he disappeared. The second
part commences here, “Then as I went;” the third
here, “Wherewith so much.”</i>
</p>

<p>
On my return, I set myself to seek out that lady
whom my master had named to me while I journeyed
sighing. And because I would be brief, I will now
narrate that in a short while I made her my surety,
in such sort that the matter was spoken of by many
in terms scarcely courteous; through the which I
had oftenwhiles many troublesome hours. And by
this it happened (to wit: by this false and evil
rumour which seemed to misfame me of vice) that
she who was the destroyer of all evil and the queen
of all good, coming where I was, denied me her
most sweet salutation, in the which alone was my
blessedness.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
And here it is fitting for me to depart a little
from this present matter, that it may be rightly
understood of what surpassing virtue her salutation
was to me. To the which end I say that when she
appeared in any place, it seemed to me, by the
hope of her excellent salutation, that there was no
man mine enemy any longer; and such warmth of
charity came upon me that most certainly in that
moment I would have pardoned whosoever had done
me an injury; and if one should then have questioned
me concerning any matter, I could only have said
unto him “Love,” with a countenance clothed in
humbleness. And what time she made ready to
salute me, the spirit of Love, destroying all other
perceptions, thrust forth the feeble spirits of my eyes,
saying, “Do homage unto your mistress,” and putting
itself in their place to obey: so that he who would,
might then have beheld Love, beholding the lids of
mine eyes shake. And when this most gentle lady
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>gave her salutation, Love, so far from being a medium
beclouding mine intolerable beatitude, then bred in
me such an overpowering sweetness that my body,
being all subjected thereto, remained many times
helpless and passive. Whereby it is made manifest
that in her salutation alone was there any beatitude
for me, which then very often went beyond my
endurance.
</p>

<p>
And now, resuming my discourse, I will go on to
relate that when, for the first time, this beatitude was
denied me, I became possessed with such grief that,
parting myself from others, I went into a lonely place
to bathe the ground with most bitter tears: and
when, by this heat of weeping, I was somewhat
relieved, I betook myself to my chamber, where I
could lament unheard. And there, having prayed to
the Lady of all Mercies, and having said also, “O
Love, aid thou thy servant,” I went suddenly asleep
like a beaten sobbing child. And in my sleep,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>towards the middle of it, I seemed to see in the
room, seated at my side, a youth in very white
raiment, who kept his eyes fixed on me in deep
thought. And when he had gazed some time, I
thought that he sighed and called to me in these
words: “<i>Fili mi, tempus est ut prætermittantur
simulata nostra.</i>”<a class="tag" id="tag16" href="#note16">[16]</a> And thereupon I seemed to
know him; for the voice was the same wherewith
he had spoken at other times in my sleep. Then
looking at him, I perceived that he was weeping
piteously, and that he seemed to be waiting for me
to speak. Wherefore, taking heart, I began thus:
“Why weepest thou, Master of all honour?” And
he made answer to me: “<i>Ego tanquam centrum
circuli, cui simili modo se habent circumferentiæ
partes: tu autem non sic.</i>”<a class="tag" id="tag17" href="#note17">[17]</a> And thinking upon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>his words, they seemed to me obscure; so that again
compelling myself unto speech, I asked of him:
“What thing is this, Master, that thou hast spoken
thus darkly?” To the which he made answer in
the vulgar tongue: “Demand no more than may be
useful to thee.” Whereupon I began to discourse
with him concerning her salutation which she had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>denied me; and when I had questioned him of the
cause, he said these words: “Our Beatrice hath
heard from certain persons, that the lady whom I
named to thee while thou journeyedst full of sighs
is sorely disquieted by thy solicitations: and therefore
this most gracious creature, who is the enemy
of all disquiet, being fearful of such disquiet, refused
to salute thee. For the which reason (albeit, in
very sooth, thy secret must needs have become
known to her by familiar observation) it is my will
that thou compose certain things in rhyme, in the
which thou shalt set forth how strong a mastership
I have obtained over thee, through her; and how
thou wast hers even from thy childhood. Also do
thou call upon him that knoweth these things to bear
witness to them, bidding him to speak with her
thereof; the which I, who am he, will do willingly.
And thus she shall be made to know thy desire;
knowing which, she shall know likewise that they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>were deceived who spake of thee to her. And so
write these things, that they shall seem rather to be
spoken by a third person; and not directly by thee
to her, which is scarce fitting. After the which, send
them, not without me, where she may chance to
hear them; but have them fitted with a pleasant
music, into the which I will pass whensoever it
needeth.” With this speech he was away, and my
sleep was broken up.
</p>

<p>
Whereupon, remembering me, I knew that I had
beheld this vision during the ninth hour of the day;
and I resolved that I would make a ditty, before I
left my chamber, according to the words my master
had spoken. And this is the ditty that I made:—
</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Song, ’tis my will that thou do seek out Love,</p>
<p class="i2">  And go with him where my dear lady is;</p>
<p class="i2">  That so my cause, the which thy harmonies</p>
<p>Do plead, his better speech may clearly prove.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>
<p>Thou goest, my Song, in such a courteous kind,</p>
<p class="i2">  That even companionless</p>
<p class="i4">    Thou mayst rely on thyself anywhere.</p>
<p>And yet, an thou wouldst get thee a safe mind,</p>
<p class="i2">  First unto Love address</p>
<p class="i4">    Thy steps; whose aid, mayhap, ’twere ill to spare,</p>
<p class="i4">    Seeing that she to whom thou mak’st thy prayer</p>
<p>Is, as I think, ill-minded unto me,</p>
<p>And that if Love do not companion thee,</p>
<p class="i2">  Thou’lt have perchance small cheer to tell me of.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>With a sweet accent, when thou com’st to her,</p>
<p class="i2">  Begin thou in these words,</p>
<p class="i4">    First having craved a gracious audience:</p>
<p>“He who hath sent me as his messenger,</p>
<p>Lady, thus much records,</p>
<p class="i4">    An thou but suffer him, in his defence.</p>
<p class="i4">    Love, who comes with me, by thine influence</p>
<p>Can make this man do as it liketh him:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
Wherefore, if this fault <i>is</i> or doth but <i>seem</i></p>
<p class="i2">  Do thou conceive: for his heart cannot move.”</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Say to her also: “Lady, his poor heart</p>
<p class="i2">  Is so confirmed in faith</p>
<p class="i4">    That all its thoughts are but of serving thee:</p>
<p>’Twas early thine, and could not swerve apart.”</p>
<p class="i2">  Then, if she wavereth,</p>
<p class="i4">    Bid her ask Love, who knows if these things be.</p>
<p class="i4">    And in the end, beg of her modestly</p>
<p>To pardon so much boldness: saying too:—</p>
<p>“If thou declare his death to be thy due,</p>
<p class="i2">  The thing shall come to pass, as doth behove.”</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Then pray thou of the Master of all ruth,</p>
<p class="i2">  Before thou leave her there,</p>
<p class="i4">    That he befriend my cause and plead it well.</p>

<i>This ditty is divided into three parts. In the first,
I tell it whither to go, and I encourage it, that it
may go the more confidently, and I tell it whose
company to join if it would go with confidence and
without any danger. In the second, I say that which
it behoves the ditty to set forth. In the third, I
give it leave to start when it pleases, recommending
its course to the arms of Fortune. The second part
begins here, “With a sweet accent;” the third here,
“Gentle my Song.” Some might contradict me, and
say that they understand not whom I address in the
second person, seeing that the ditty is merely the
very words I am speaking. And therefore I say
that this doubt I intend to solve and clear up in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>this little book itself, at a more difficult passage,
and then let him understand who now doubts, or
would now contradict as aforesaid.</i>
</p>

<p>
After this vision I have recorded, and having
written those words which Love had dictated to
me, I began to be harassed with many and divers
thoughts, by each of which I was sorely tempted;
and in especial, there were four among them that
left me no rest. The first was this: “Certainly the
lordship of Love is good; seeing that it diverts
the mind from all mean things.” The second was
this: “Certainly the lordship of Love is evil;
seeing that the more homage his servants pay to
him, the more grievous and painful are the torments
wherewith he torments them.” The third was
this: “The name of Love is so sweet in the hearing
that it would not seem possible for its effects to
be other than sweet; seeing that the name must
needs be like unto the thing named; as it is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>written: <i>Nomina sunt consequentia rerum.</i>”<a class="tag" id="tag18" href="#note18">[18]</a> And
the fourth was this: “The lady whom Love hath
chosen out to govern thee is not as other ladies,
whose hearts are easily moved.”
</p>

<p>
And by each one of these thoughts I was so
sorely assailed that I was like unto him who
doubteth which path to take, and wishing to go,
goeth not. And if I bethought myself to seek out
some point at the which all these paths might be
found to meet, I discerned but one way, and that
irked me; to wit, to call upon Pity, and to commend
myself unto her. And it was then that, feeling
a desire to write somewhat thereof in rhyme, I
wrote this sonnet:—
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>All my thoughts always speak to me of Love,</p>
<p class="i2">  Yet have between themselves such difference</p>
<p class="i2">  That while one bids me bow with mind and sense,</p>
<p>A second saith, “Go to: look thou above;”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
The third one, hoping, yields me joy enough;</p>
<p class="i2">  And with the last come tears, I scarce know whence:</p>
<p class="i2">  All of them craving pity in sore suspense,</p>
<p>Trembling with fears that the heart knoweth of.</p>
<p>And thus, being all unsure which path to take,</p>
<p class="i2">  Wishing to speak I know not what to say,</p>
<p class="i4">    And lose myself in amorous wanderings:</p>
<p>Until, (my peace with all of them to make,)</p>
<p class="i2">  Unto mine enemy I needs must pray,</p>
<p class="i4">    My Lady Pity, for the help she brings.</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>This sonnet may be divided into four parts. In
the first, I say and propound that all my thoughts
are concerning Love. In the second, I say that they
are diverse, and I relate their diversity. In the
third, I say wherein they all seem to agree. In the
fourth, I say that, wishing to speak of Love, I
know not from which of these thoughts to take my
argument; and that if I would take it from all, I</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span><i>shall have to call upon mine enemy, my Lady Pity.
“Lady” I say, as in a scornful mode of speech.
The second begins here, “Yet have between themselves;”
the third, “All of them craving;” the
fourth, “And thus.”</i>
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
After this battling with many thoughts, it chanced
on a day that my most gracious lady was with
a gathering of ladies in a certain place; to the
which I was conducted by a friend of mine; he
thinking to do me a great pleasure by showing
me the beauty of so many women. Then I,
hardly knowing whereunto he conducted me, but
trusting in him (who yet was leading his friend to
the last verge of life), made question: “To what
end are we come among these ladies?” and he
answered: “To the end that they may be worthily
served.” And they were assembled around a
gentlewoman who was given in marriage on that
day; the custom of the city being that these should
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>bear her company when she sat down for the
first time at table in the house of her husband.
Therefore I, as was my friend’s pleasure, resolved
to stay with him and do honour to those ladies.
</p>

<p>
But as soon as I had thus resolved, I began to
feel a faintness and a throbbing at my left side,
which soon took possession of my whole body.
Whereupon I remember that I covertly leaned my
back unto a painting that ran round the walls of
that house; and being fearful lest my trembling
should be discerned of them, I lifted mine eyes
to look on those ladies, and then first perceived
among them the excellent Beatrice. And when
I perceived her, all my senses were overpowered
by the great lordship that Love obtained, finding
himself so near unto that most gracious being, until
nothing but the spirits of sight remained to me;
and even these remained driven out of their own
instruments because Love entered in that honoured
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>place of theirs, that so he might the better
behold her. And although I was other than at first,
I grieved for the spirits so expelled, which kept up
a sore lament, saying: “If he had not in this
wise thrust us forth, we also should behold the
marvel of this lady.” By this, many of her friends,
having discerned my confusion, began to wonder;
and together with herself, kept whispering of me
and mocking me. Whereupon my friend, who knew
not what to conceive, took me by the hands, and
drawing me forth from among them, required to know
what ailed me. Then, having first held me at quiet
for a space until my perceptions were come back
to me, I made answer to my friend: “Of a surety
I have now set my feet on that point of life,
beyond the which he must not pass who would
return.”<a class="tag" id="tag19" href="#note19">[19]</a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
Afterwards, leaving him, I went back to the room
where I had wept before; and again weeping and
ashamed, said: “If this lady but knew of my
condition, I do not think that she would thus
mock at me; nay, I am sure that she must needs
feel some pity.” And in my weeping I bethought
me to write certain words, in the which, speaking
to her, I should signify the occasion of my
disfigurement, telling her also how I knew that
she had no knowledge thereof: which, if it were
known, I was certain must move others to pity.
And then, because I hoped that peradventure
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>it might come into her hearing, I wrote this
sonnet:—
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Even as the others mock, thou mockest me;</p>
<p class="i2">  Not dreaming, noble lady, whence it is</p>
<p class="i2">  That I am taken with strange semblances,</p>
<p>Seeing thy face which is so fair to see:</p>
<p>For else, compassion would not suffer thee</p>
<p class="i2">  To grieve my heart with such harsh scoffs as these.</p>
<p class="i2">  Lo! Love, when thou art present, sits at ease,</p>
<p>And bears his mastership so mightily,</p>
<p>That all my troubled senses he thrusts out,</p>
<p class="i2">  Sorely tormenting some, and slaying some,</p>
<p class="i4">    Till none but he is left and has free range</p>
<p class="i4">    To gaze on thee. This makes my face to change</p>
<p class="i2">  Into another’s; while I stand all dumb,</p>
<p>And hear my senses clamour in their rout.</p></div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
<i>This sonnet I divide not into parts, because a
division is only made to open the meaning of the
thing divided: and this, as it is sufficiently manifest
through the reasons given, has no need of division.
True it is that, amid the words whereby is shown
the occasion of this sonnet, dubious words are to be
found; namely, when I say that Love kills all my
spirits, but that the visual remain in life, only outside
of their own instruments. And this difficulty
it is impossible for any to solve who is not in equal
guise liege unto Love; and, to those who are so,
that is manifest which would clear up the dubious
words. And therefore it were not well for me to
expound this difficulty, inasmuch as my speaking
would be either fruitless or else superfluous.</i>
</p>

<p>
A while after this strange disfigurement, I became
possessed with a strong conception which left me
but very seldom, and then to return quickly. And
it was this: “Seeing that thou comest into such
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>scorn by the companionship of this lady, wherefore
seekest thou to behold her? If she should ask thee
this thing, what answer couldst thou make unto
her? yea, even though thou wert master of all thy
faculties, and in no way hindered from answering.”
Unto the which, another very humble thought said
in reply: “If I were master of all my faculties, and
in no way hindered from answering, I would tell
her that no sooner do I image to myself her marvellous
beauty than I am possessed with a desire
to behold her, the which is of so great strength that
it kills and destroys in my memory all those things
which might oppose it; and it is therefore that the
great anguish I have endured thereby is yet not
enough to restrain me from seeking to behold her.”
And then, because of these thoughts, I resolved to
write somewhat, wherein, having pleaded mine excuse,
I should tell her of what I felt in her presence.
Whereupon I wrote this sonnet:—
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<p>The thoughts are broken in my memory,</p>
<p class="i2">  Thou lovely Joy, whene’er I see thy face;</p>
<p class="i2">  When thou art near me, Love fills up the space,</p>
<p>Often repeating, “If death irk thee, fly.”</p>
<p>My face shows my heart’s colour, verily,</p>
<p class="i2">  Which, fainting, seeks for any leaning-place;</p>
<p class="i2">  Till, in the drunken terror of disgrace,</p>
<p>The very stones seem to be shrieking, “Die!”</p>
<p>It were a grievous sin, if one should not</p>
<p class="i2">  Strive then to comfort my bewildered mind</p>
<p class="i4">    (Though merely with a simple pitying)</p>
<p>For the great anguish which thy scorn has wrought</p>
<p class="i2">  In the dead sight o’ the eyes grown nearly blind,</p>
<p class="i4">    Which look for death as for a blessed thing.</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>This sonnet is divided into two parts. In the first,
I tell the cause why I abstain not from coming to
this lady. In the second, I tell what befalls me
through coming to her; and this part begins here</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span><i>“When thou art near.” And also this second part
divides into five distinct statements. For, in the
first, I say what Love, counselled by Reason, tells
me when I am near the lady. In the second, I
set forth the state of my heart by the example of the
face. In the third, I say how all ground of trust
fails me. In the fourth, I say that he sins who
shows not pity of me, which would give me some
comfort. In the last, I say why people should take
pity: namely, for the piteous look which comes into
mine eyes; which piteous look is destroyed, that is,
appeareth not unto others, through the jeering of this
lady, who draws to the like action those who peradventure
would see this piteousness. The second
part begins here, “My face shows;” the third, “Till,
in the drunken terror;” the fourth, “It were a
grievous sin;” the fifth, “For the great anguish.”</i>
</p>

<p>
Thereafter, this sonnet bred in me desire to write
down in verse four other things touching my condition,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>the which things it seemed to me that I had
not yet made manifest. The first among these was
the grief that possessed me very often, remembering
the strangeness which Love wrought in me; the
second was, how Love many times assailed me so
suddenly and with such strength that I had no other
life remaining except a thought which spake of my
lady; the third was, how, when Love did battle
with me in this wise, I would rise up all colourless,
if so I might see my lady, conceiving that the sight
of her would defend me against the assault of Love,
and altogether forgetting that which her presence
brought unto me; and the fourth was, how, when
I saw her, the sight not only defended me not, but
took away the little life that remained to me. And
I said these four things in a sonnet, which is this:—
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>At whiles (yea oftentimes) I muse over</p>
<p class="i2">  The quality of anguish that is mine</p>
<p class="i2">  Through Love: then pity makes my voice to pine,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>Saying, “Is any else thus, anywhere?”</p>
<p>Love smiteth me, whose strength is ill to bear;</p>
<p class="i2">  So that of all my life is left no sign</p>
<p class="i2">  Except one thought; and that, because ’tis thine,</p>
<p>Leaves not the body but abideth there.</p>
<p>And then if I, whom other aid forsook,</p>
<p class="i2">  Would aid myself, and innocent of art</p>
<p class="i4">    Would fain have sight of thee as a last hope,</p>
<p>No sooner do I lift mine eyes to look</p>
<p class="i2">  Than the blood seems as shaken from my heart,</p>
<p class="i4">    And all my pulses beat at once and stop.</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>This sonnet is divided into four parts, four things
being therein narrated; and as these are set forth
above, I only proceed to distinguish the parts by their
beginnings. Wherefore I say that the second part
begins, “Love smiteth me;” the third, “And then
if I;” the fourth, “No sooner do I lift.”</i>
</p>

<p>
After I had written these three last sonnets,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>wherein I spake unto my lady, telling her almost
the whole of my condition, it seemed to me that I
should be silent, having said enough concerning
myself. But albeit I spake not to her again, yet it
behoved me afterward to write of another matter,
more noble than the foregoing. And for that the
occasion of what I then wrote may be found pleasant
in the hearing, I will relate it as briefly as I may.
</p>

<p>
Through the sore change in mine aspect, the
secret of my heart was now understood of many.
Which thing being thus, there came a day when
certain ladies to whom it was well known (they having
been with me at divers times in my trouble) were
met together for the pleasure of gentle company.
And as I was going that way by chance, (but I
think rather by the will of fortune,) I heard one
of them call unto me, and she that called was a
lady of very sweet speech. And when I had
come close up with them, and perceived that they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>had not among them mine excellent lady, I was
reassured; and saluted them, asking of their
pleasure. The ladies were many; divers of whom
were laughing one to another, while divers gazed
at me as though I should speak anon. But when
I still spake not, one of them, who before had
been talking with another, addressed me by my
name, saying, “To what end lovest thou this lady,
seeing that thou canst not support her presence?
Now tell us this thing, that we may know it: for
certainly the end of such a love must be worthy
of knowledge.” And when she had spoken these
words, not she only, but all they that were with
her, began to observe me, waiting for my reply.
Whereupon I said thus unto them:—”Ladies, the
end and aim of my Love was but the salutation of
that lady of whom I conceive that ye are speaking;
wherein alone I found that beatitude which is the
goal of desire. And now that it hath pleased her
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>to deny me this, Love, my Master, of his great
goodness, hath placed all my beatitude there
where my hope will not fail me.” Then those
ladies began to talk closely together; and as I
have seen snow fall among the rain, so was their
talk mingled with sighs. But after a little, that
lady who had been the first to address me,
addressed me again in these words: “We pray
thee that thou wilt tell us wherein abideth this thy
beatitude.” And answering, I said but thus much:
“In those words that do praise my lady.” To
the which she rejoined: “If thy speech were true,
those words that thou didst write concerning thy
condition would have been written with another intent.”
</p>

<p>
Then I, being almost put to shame because of
her answer, went out from among them; and as I
walked, I said within myself: “Seeing that there is
so much beatitude in those words which do praise
my lady, wherefore hath my speech of her been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>different?” And then I resolved that thenceforward
I would choose for the theme of my writings only
the praise of this most gracious being. But when
I had thought exceedingly, it seemed to me that I
had taken to myself a theme which was much too
lofty, so that I dared not begin; and I remained
during several days in the desire of speaking, and
the fear of beginning. After which it happened, as I
passed one day along a path which lay beside a
stream of very clear water, that there came upon me
a great desire to say somewhat in rhyme: but when
I began thinking how I should say it, methought
that to speak of her were unseemly, unless I
spoke to other ladies in the second person; which
is to say, not to <i>any</i> other ladies, but only to such
as are so called because they are gentle, let alone
for mere womanhood. Whereupon I declare that
my tongue spake as though by its own impulse,
and said, “Ladies that have intelligence in love.”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>These words I laid up in my mind with great gladness,
conceiving to take them as my commencement.
Wherefore, having returned to the city I spake of, and
considered thereof during certain days, I began a poem
with this beginning, constructed in the mode which will
be seen below in its division. The poem begins here:—
</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Ladies that have intelligence in love,</p>
<p class="i2">  Of mine own lady I would speak with you;</p>
<p class="i2">  Not that I hope to count her praises through,</p>
<p class="i4">    But telling what I may, to ease my mind.</p>
<p>And I declare that when I speak thereof,</p>
<p>Love sheds such perfect sweetness over me</p>
<p>That if my courage failed not, certainly</p>
<p class="i4">    To him my listeners must be all resign’d.</p>
<p class="i4">    Wherefore I will not speak in such large kind</p>
<p>That mine own speech should foil me, which were base;</p>
<p>But only will discourse of her high grace</p>
<p class="i4">    In these poor words, the best that I can find,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>With you alone, dear dames and damozels:</p>
<p>’Twere ill to speak thereof with any else.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>An Angel, of his blessed knowledge, saith</p>
<p class="i2">  To God: “Lord, in the world that Thou hast made,</p>
<p class="i2">  A miracle in action is display’d,</p>
<p class="i4">    By reason of a soul whose splendours fare</p>
<p>Even hither: and since Heaven requireth</p>
<p>Nought saving her, for her it prayeth Thee,</p>
<p>Thy Saints crying aloud continually.”</p>
<p class="i4">    Yet Pity still defends our earthly share</p>
<p class="i4">    In that sweet soul; God answering thus the prayer:</p>
<p>“My well-belovèd, suffer that in peace</p>
<p>Your hope remain, while so My pleasure is,</p>
<p class="i4">    There where one dwells who dreads the loss of her:</p>
<p>And who in Hell unto the doomed shall say,</p>
<p>‘I have looked on that for which God’s chosen pray.’”</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>My lady is desired in the high Heaven:</p>
<p class="i2">  <i>Wherefore</i>, it now behoveth me to tell,</p>
<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>  Saying: Let any maid that would be well</p>
<p class="i4">    Esteemed keep with her: for as she goes by,</p>
<p>Into foul hearts a deathly chill is driven</p>
<p>By Love, that makes ill thought to perish there:</p>
<p>While any who endures to gaze on her</p>
<p class="i4">    Must either be ennobled, or else die.</p>
<p class="i4">    When one deserving to be raised so high</p>
<p>Is found, ’tis then her power attains its proof,</p>
<p>Making his heart strong for his soul’s behoof</p>
<p class="i4">    With the full strength of meek humility.</p>
<p>Also this virtue owns she, by God’s will:</p>
<p>Who speaks with her can never come to ill.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Love saith concerning her: “How chanceth it</p>
<p class="i2">  That flesh, which is of dust, should be thus pure?”</p>
<p class="i2">  Then, gazing always, he makes oath: “Forsure,</p>
<p class="i4">    This is a creature of God till now unknown.”</p>
<p>She hath that paleness of the pearl that’s fit</p>
<p>In a fair woman, so much and not more;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>She is as high as Nature’s skill can soar;</p>
<p class="i4">    Beauty is tried by her comparison.</p>
<p class="i4">    Whatever her sweet eyes are turned upon,</p>
<p>Spirits of love do issue thence in flame,</p>
<p>Which through their eyes who then may look on them</p>
<p class="i4">    Pierce to the heart’s deep chamber every one.</p>
<p>And in her smile Love’s image you may see;</p>
<p>Whence none can gaze upon her steadfastly.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Dear Song, I know thou wilt hold gentle speech</p>
<p class="i2">  With many ladies, when I send thee forth:</p>
<p class="i2">  Wherefore (being mindful that thou hadst thy birth</p>
<p class="i4">    From Love, and art a modest, simple child),</p>
<p>Whomso thou meetest, say thou this to each:</p>
<p>“Give me good speed! To her I wend along</p>
<p>In whose much strength my weakness is made strong.”</p>
<p class="i4">    And if, i’ the end, thou wouldst not be beguiled</p>
<p class="i4">    Of all thy labour, seek not the defiled</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>And common sort; but rather choose to be</p>
<p>Where man and woman dwell in courtesy.</p>
<p class="i4">    So to the road thou shalt be reconciled,</p>
<p>And find the lady, and with the lady, Love.</p>
<p>Commend thou me to each, as doth behove.</p>

<p>
<i>This poem, that it may be better understood, I will
divide more subtly than the others preceding; and
therefore I will make three parts of it. The first
part is a proem to the words following. The second
is the matter treated of. The third is, as it were,
a handmaid to the preceding words. The second
begins here, “An Angel;” the third here, “Dear
Song, I know.” The first part is divided into four.
In the first, I say to whom I mean to speak of my
lady, and wherefore I will so speak. In the second,
I say what she appears to myself to be when I reflect
upon her excellence, and what I would utter if I
lost not courage. In the third, I say what it is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>I purpose to speak so as not to be impeded by
faintheartedness. In the fourth, repeating to whom
I purpose speaking, I tell the reason why I speak
to them. The second begins here, “And I declare;”
the third here, “Wherefore I will not speak;” the
fourth here, “With you alone.” Then, when I say
“An Angel,” I begin treating of this lady: and
this part is divided into two. In the first, I tell
what is understood of her in heaven. In the second,
I tell what is understood of her on earth: here, “My
lady is desired.” This second part is divided into
two; for, in the first, I speak of her as regards the
nobleness of her soul, relating some of her virtues
proceeding from her soul; in the second, I speak of
her as regards the nobleness of her body, narrating
some of her beauties: here, “Love saith concerning
her.” This second part is divided into two, for,
in the first, I speak of certain beauties which belong
to the whole person; in the second, I speak of certain
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>beauties which belong to a distinct part of the person:
here, “Whatever her sweet eyes.” This second part
is divided into two; for, in the one, I speak of the
eyes, which are the beginning of love; in the second,
I speak of the mouth, which is the end of love. And
that every vicious thought may be discarded herefrom,
let the reader remember that it is above written
that the greeting of this lady, which was an act of
her mouth, was the goal of my desires, while I
could receive it. Then, when I say, “Dear Song,
I know,” I add a stanza as it were handmaid to the
others, wherein I say what I desire from this my
poem. And because this last part is easy to understand,
I trouble not myself with more divisions. I
say, indeed, that the further to open the meaning of
this poem, more minute divisions ought to be used;
but nevertheless he who is not of wit enough to
understand it by these which have been already made
is welcome to leave it alone; for certes, I fear I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>have communicated its sense to too many by these present
divisions, if it so happened that many should hear it.</i>
</p>

<p>
When this song was a little gone abroad, a certain
one of my friends, hearing the same, was pleased to
question me, that I should tell him what thing love
is; it may be, conceiving from the words thus heard a
hope of me beyond my desert. Wherefore I, thinking
that after such discourse it were well to say somewhat
of the nature of Love, and also in accordance
with my friend’s desire, proposed to myself to write
certain words in the which I should treat of this argument.
And the sonnet that I then made is this:—
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Love and the gentle heart are one same thing,</p>
<p class="i2">  Even as the wise man<a class="tag" id="tag20" href="#note20">[20]</a> in his ditty saith:</p>
<p class="i2">  Each, of itself, would be such life in death</p>
<p>As rational soul bereft of reasoning.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>’Tis Nature makes them when she loves: a king</p>
<p class="i2">  Love is, whose palace where he sojourneth</p>
<p class="i2">  Is called the Heart; there draws he quiet breath</p>
<p>At first, with brief or longer slumbering.</p>
<p>Then beauty seen in virtuous womankind</p>
<p class="i2">  Will make the eyes desire, and through the heart</p>
<p class="i4">    Send the desiring of the eyes again;</p>
<p>Where often it abides so long enshrin’d</p>
<p class="i2">  That Love at length out of his sleep will start.</p>
<p class="i4">    And women feel the same for worthy men.</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>This sonnet is divided into two parts. In the
first, I speak of him according to his power. In
the second, I speak of him according as his power
translates itself into act. The second part begins
here, “Then beauty seen.” The first is divided into
two. In the first, I say in what subject this power
exists. In the second, I say how this subject
and this power are produced together, and how the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>one regards the other, as form does matter. The
second begins here, “’Tis Nature.” Afterwards
when I say, “Then beauty seen in virtuous
womankind,” I say how this power translates itself
into act; and, first, how it so translates itself
in a man, then how it so translates itself in a
woman: here, “And women feel.”</i>
</p>

<p>
Having treated of love in the foregoing, it appeared
to me that I should also say something in praise of
my lady, wherein it might be set forth how love
manifested itself when produced by her; and how
not only she could awaken it where it slept, but
where it was not she could marvellously create it.
To the which end I wrote another sonnet; and it
is this:—
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>My lady carries love within her eyes;</p>
<p class="i2">  All that she looks on is made pleasanter;</p>
<p class="i2">  Upon her path men turn to gaze at her;</p>
<p>He whom she greeteth feels his heart to rise,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>And droops his troubled visage, full of sighs,</p>
<p class="i2">  And of his evil heart is then aware:</p>
<p class="i2">  Hate loves, and pride becomes a worshipper.</p>
<p>O women, help to praise her in somewise.</p>
<p>Humbleness, and the hope that hopeth well,</p>
<p class="i2">  By speech of hers into the mind are brought,</p>
<p class="i4">    And who beholds is blessèd oftenwhiles.</p>
<p class="i4">    The look she hath when she a little smiles</p>
<p class="i2">  Cannot be said, nor holden in the thought;</p>
<p>’Tis such a new and gracious miracle.</p></div>

<p>
<i>This sonnet has three sections. In the first, I
say how this lady brings this power into action
by those most noble features, her eyes; and, in the
third, I say this same as to that most noble
feature, her mouth. And between these two sections
is a little section, which asks, as it were, help for
the previous section and the subsequent; and it
begins here, “O women, help.” The third begins
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>here, “Humbleness.” The first is divided into
three; for, in the first, I say how she with power
makes noble that which she looks upon; and this
is as much as to say that she brings Love, in
power, thither where he is not. In the second, I
say how she brings Love, in act, into the hearts
of all those whom she sees. In the third, I tell
what she afterwards, with virtue, operates upon
their hearts. The second begins, “Upon her path;”
the third, “He whom she greeteth.” Then, when
I say, “O women, help,” I intimate to whom it is
my intention to speak, calling on women to help
me to honour her. Then, when I say, “Humbleness,”
I say that same which is said in the first
part, regarding two acts of her mouth, one whereof
is her most sweet speech, and the other her
marvellous smile. Only, I say not of this last
how it operates upon the hearts of others, because
memory cannot retain this smile, nor its operation.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
Not many days after this (it being the will of the
most High God, who also from Himself put not
away death), the father of wonderful Beatrice, going
out of this life, passed certainly into glory. Thereby
it happened, as of very sooth it might not be otherwise,
that this lady was made full of the bitterness
of grief: seeing that such a parting is very grievous
unto those friends who are left, and that no other
friendship is like to that between a good parent and
a good child; and furthermore considering that this
lady was good in the supreme degree, and her
father (as by many it hath been truly averred) of
exceeding goodness. And because it is the usage
of that city that men meet with men in such a grief,
and women with women, certain ladies of her companionship
gathered themselves unto Beatrice, where
she kept alone in her weeping: and as they passed
in and out, I could hear them speak concerning her,
how she wept. At length two of them went by me,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>who said: “Certainly she grieveth in such sort that
one might die for pity, beholding her.” Then, feeling
the tears upon my face, I put up my hands to hide
them: and had it not been that I hoped to hear
more concerning her (seeing that where I sat, her
friends passed continually in and out), I should
assuredly have gone thence to be alone, when I
felt the tears come. But as I still sat in that place,
certain ladies again passed near me, who were saying
among themselves: “Which of us shall be joyful
any more, who have listened to this lady in her
piteous sorrow?” And there were others who said
as they went by me: “He that sitteth here could
not weep more if he had beheld her as we have
beheld her;” and again: “He is so altered that he
seemeth not as himself.” And still as the ladies
passed to and fro, I could hear them speak after
this fashion of her and of me.
</p>

<p>
Wherefore afterwards, having considered and perceiving
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>that there was herein matter for poesy, I
resolved that I would write certain rhymes in the
which should be contained all that those ladies had
said. And because I would willingly have spoken
to them if it had not been for discreetness, I made
in my rhymes as though I had spoken and they
had answered me. And thereof I wrote two sonnets;
in the first of which I addressed them as I would
fain have done; and in the second related their
answer, using the speech that I had heard from them,
as though it had been spoken unto myself. And
the sonnets are these:—
</p>

<p class="center large">
I.
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>You that thus wear a modest countenance</p>
<p class="i2">  With lids weigh’d down by the heart’s heaviness,</p>
<p class="i2">  Whence come you, that among you every face</p>
<p>Appears the same, for its pale troubled glance?</p>
<p>Have you beheld my lady’s face, perchance,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>  Bow’d with the grief that Love makes full of grace?</p>
<p class="i2">  Say now, “This thing is thus;” as my heart says,</p>
<p>Marking your grave and sorrowful advance.</p>
<p>And if indeed you come from where she sighs</p>
<p class="i2">  And mourns, may it please you (for his heart’s relief)</p>
<p class="i4">    To tell how it fares with her unto him</p>
<p>Who knows that you have wept, seeing your eyes,</p>
<p class="i2">  And is so grieved with looking on your grief</p>
<p class="i4">    That his heart trembles and his sight grows dim.</p></div>

<p>
<i>This sonnet is divided into two parts. In the
first, I call and ask these ladies whether they
come from her, telling them that I think they do,
because they return the nobler. In the second, I
pray them to tell me of her; and the second begins
here, “And if indeed.”</i>
</p>

<p class="center large">
II.
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Canst thou indeed be he that still would sing</p>
<p class="i2">  Of our dear lady unto none but us?</p>
<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>  For though thy voice confirms that it is thus,</p>
<p>Thy visage might another witness bring.</p>
<p>And wherefore is thy grief so sore a thing</p>
<p class="i2">  That grieving thou mak’st others dolorous?</p>
<p class="i2">  Hast thou too seen her weep, that thou from us</p>

<p>Nay, leave our woe to us: let us alone:</p>
<p class="i2">  ’Twere sin if one should strive to soothe our woe,</p>
<p class="i4">    For in her weeping we have heard her speak:</p>

<p class="i4">    Must fall aswoon, feeling all life grow weak.</p></div>

<p>
<i>This sonnet has four parts, as the ladies in whose
person I reply had four forms of answer. And,
because these are sufficiently shown above, I stay not
to explain the purport of the parts, and therefore
I only discriminate them. The second begins here,
“And wherefore is thy grief;” the third here,</i>

<p>
A few days after this, my body became afflicted
with a painful infirmity, whereby I suffered bitter
anguish for many days, which at last brought me
unto such weakness that I could no longer move.
And I remember that on the ninth day, being overcome
with intolerable pain, a thought came into my
mind concerning my lady: but when it had a little
nourished this thought, my mind returned to its
brooding over mine enfeebled body. And then
perceiving how frail a thing life is, even though health
keep with it, the matter seemed to me so pitiful that
I could not choose but weep; and weeping I said
within myself: “Certainly it must some time come
to pass that the very gentle Beatrice will die.” Then,
feeling bewildered, I closed mine eyes; and my brain
began to be in travail as the brain of one frantic,
and to have such imaginations as here follow.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
And at the first, it seemed to me that I saw certain
faces of women with their hair loosened, which called
out to me, “Thou shalt surely die;” after the which,
other terrible and unknown appearances said unto
me, “Thou art dead.” At length, as my phantasy
held on in its wanderings, I came to be I knew not
where, and to behold a throng of dishevelled ladies
wonderfully sad, who kept going hither and thither
weeping. Then the sun went out, so that the stars
showed themselves, and they were of such a colour
that I knew they must be weeping: and it seemed
to me that the birds fell dead out of the sky, and
that there were great earthquakes. With that, while
I wondered in my trance, and was filled with a
grievous fear, I conceived that a certain friend came
unto me and said: “Hast thou not heard? She
that was thine excellent lady hath been taken out
of life.” Then I began to weep very piteously; and
not only in mine imagination, but with mine eyes,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>which were wet with tears. And I seemed to look
towards Heaven, and to behold a multitude of angels
who were returning upwards, having before them
an exceedingly white cloud: and these angels were
singing together gloriously, and the words of their
song were these: “<i>Osanna in excelsis</i>;” and there
was no more that I heard. Then my heart that was
so full of love said unto me: “It is true that our
lady lieth dead;” and it seemed to me that I went
to look upon the body wherein that blessed and
most noble spirit had had its abiding-place. And
so strong was this idle imagining, that it made me
to behold my lady in death; whose head certain
ladies seemed to be covering with a white veil; and
who was so humble of her aspect that it was as
though she had said, “I have attained to look on
the beginning of peace.” And therewithal I came
unto such humility by the sight of her, that I cried
out upon Death, saying: “Now come unto me, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>be not bitter against me any longer: surely, there
where thou hast been, thou hast learned gentleness.
Wherefore come now unto me who do greatly desire
thee: seest thou not that I wear thy colour already?”
And when I had seen all those offices performed
that are fitting to be done unto the dead, it seemed
to me that I went back unto mine own chamber,
and looked up towards Heaven. And so strong
was my phantasy, that I wept again in very truth,
and said with my true voice: “O excellent soul!
how blessed is he that now looketh upon thee!”
</p>

<p>
And as I said these words, with a painful anguish
of sobbing and another prayer unto Death, a young
and gentle lady, who had been standing beside me
where I lay, conceiving that I wept and cried out
because of the pain of mine infirmity, was taken
with trembling and began to shed tears. Whereby
other ladies, who were about the room, becoming
aware of my discomfort by reason of the moan that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>she made, (who indeed was of my very near kindred,)
led her away from where I was, and then set themselves
to awaken me, thinking that I dreamed, and
saying: “Sleep no longer, and be not disquieted.”
</p>

<p>
Then, by their words, this strong imagination was
brought suddenly to an end, at the moment that I
was about to say, “O Beatrice! peace be with thee.”
And already I had said, “O Beatrice!” when being
aroused, I opened mine eyes, and knew that it had
been a deception. But albeit I had indeed uttered
her name, yet my voice was so broken with sobs,
that it was not understood by these ladies; so that
in spite of the sore shame that I felt, I turned
towards them by Love’s counselling. And when
they beheld me, they began to say, “He seemeth
as one dead,” and to whisper among themselves,
“Let us strive if we may not comfort him.” Whereupon
they spake to me many soothing words, and
questioned me moreover touching the cause of my
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>fear. Then I, being somewhat reassured, and having
perceived that it was a mere phantasy, said unto
them, “This thing it was that made me afeard;”
and told them of all that I had seen, from the beginning
even unto the end, but without once speaking
the name of my lady. Also, after I had recovered
from my sickness, I bethought me to write these
things in rhyme; deeming it a lovely thing to be
known. Whereof I wrote this poem:—
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>A very pitiful lady, very young,</p>
<p class="i2">  Exceeding rich in human sympathies,</p>
<p class="i4">    Stood by, what time I clamour’d upon Death;</p>
<p>And at the wild words wandering on my tongue</p>
<p class="i2">  And at the piteous look within mine eyes</p>
<p class="i4">    She was affrighted, that sobs choked her breath.</p>
<p class="i4">    So by her weeping where I lay beneath,</p>
<p>Some other gentle ladies came to know</p>
<p>My state, and made her go:</p>
<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>  Afterward, bending themselves over me,</p>
<p class="i2">  One said, “Awaken thee!”</p>
<p class="i4">    And one, “What thing thy sleep disquieteth?”</p>
<p>With that, my soul woke up from its eclipse,</p>
<p>The while my lady’s name rose to my lips:</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>But utter’d in a voice so sob-broken,</p>
<p class="i2">  So feeble with the agony of tears,</p>
<p class="i4">    That I alone might hear it in my heart;</p>
<p>And though that look was on my visage then</p>
<p class="i2">  Which he who is ashamed so plainly wears,</p>
<p class="i4">    Love made that I through shame held not apart,</p>
<p class="i4">    But gazed upon them. And my hue was such</p>
<p>That they look’d at each other and thought of death;</p>
<p>Saying under their breath</p>
<p class="i2">  Most tenderly, “O let us comfort him:”</p>
<p class="i2">  Then unto me: “What dream</p>
<p class="i4">    Was thine, that it hath shaken thee so much?”</p>
<p>And when I was a little comforted,</p>
<p>“This, ladies, was the dream I dreamt,” I said.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>
<p>“I was a-thinking how life fails with us</p>
<p class="i2">  Suddenly after such a little while;</p>
<p class="i4">    When Love sobb’d in my heart, which is his home.</p>
<p>Whereby my spirit wax’d so dolorous</p>
<p class="i2">  That in myself I said, with sick recoil:</p>
<p class="i4">    ‘Yea, to my lady too this Death must come.’</p>
<p class="i4">    And therewithal such a bewilderment</p>
<p>Possess’d me, that I shut mine eyes for peace;</p>
<p>And in my brain did cease</p>
<p class="i2">  Order of thought, and every healthful thing.</p>
<p class="i2">  Afterwards, wandering</p>
<p class="i4">    Amid a swarm of doubts that came and went,</p>
<p>Some certain women’s faces hurried by,</p>
<p>And shriek’d to me, ‘Thou too shalt die, shalt die!’</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>“Then saw I many broken hinted sights</p>
<p class="i2">  In the uncertain state I stepp’d into.</p>
<p class="i4">    Meseem’d to be I know not in what place,</p>
<p>Where ladies through the street, like mournful lights,</p>
<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>  Ran with loose hair, and eyes that frighten’d you</p>
<p class="i4">    By their own terror, and a pale amaze:</p>
<p class="i4">    The while, little by little, as I thought,</p>
<p>The sun ceased, and the stars began to gather,</p>
<p>And each wept at the other;</p>
<p class="i2">  And birds dropp’d in mid-flight out of the sky;</p>
<p class="i2">  And earth shook suddenly;</p>
<p class="i4">    And I was ’ware of one, hoarse and tired out,</p>
<p>Who ask’d of me: ‘Hast thou not heard it said?...</p>
<p>Thy lady, she that was so fair, is dead.’</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>“Then lifting up mine eyes, as the tears came,</p>
<p class="i2">  I saw the Angels, like a rain of manna,</p>
<p class="i4">    In a long flight flying back Heavenward;</p>
<p>Having a little cloud in front of them,</p>
<p class="i2">  After the which they went and said, ‘Hosanna;’</p>
<p class="i4">    And if they had said more, you should have heard.</p>
<p class="i4">    Then Love said, ‘Now shall all things be made clear:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>Come and behold our lady where she lies.’</p>
<p>These ’wildering phantasies</p>
<p class="i2">  Then carried me to see my lady dead.</p>
<p class="i2">  Even as I there was led,</p>
<p class="i4">    Her ladies with a veil were covering her;</p>
<p>And with her was such very humbleness</p>
<p>That she appeared to say, ‘I am at peace.’</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>“And I became so humble in my grief,</p>
<p class="i2">  Seeing in her such deep humility,</p>
<p class="i4">    That I said: ‘Death, I hold thee passing good</p>
<p>Henceforth, and a most gentle sweet relief,</p>
<p class="i2">  Since my dear love has chosen to dwell with thee:</p>
<p class="i4">    Pity, not hate, is thine, well understood.</p>
<p class="i4">    Lo! I do so desire to see thy face</p>
<p>That I am like as one who nears the tomb;</p>
<p>My soul entreats thee, Come.’</p>
<p class="i2">  Then I departed, having made my moan;</p>
<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>  And when I was alone</p>
<p class="i4">    I said, and cast my eyes to the High Place:</p>
<p>‘Blessed is he, fair soul, who meets thy glance!’</p>
<p>... Just then you woke me, of your complaisaùnce.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
<i>This poem has two parts. In the first, speaking
to a person undefined, I tell how I was aroused
from a vain phantasy by certain ladies, and how
I promised them to tell what it was. In the
second, I say how I told them. The second part
begins here, “I was a-thinking.” The first part
divides into two. In the first, I tell that which certain
ladies, and which one singly, did and said because
of my phantasy, before I had returned into my right
senses. In the second, I tell what these ladies said
to me after I had left off this wandering: and it
begins here, “But uttered in a voice.” Then, when
I say, “I was a-thinking,” I say how I told them this</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span><i>my imagination; and concerning this I have two
parts. In the first, I tell, in order, this imagination.
In the second, saying at what time they called me,
I covertly thank them: and this part begins here,
“Just then you woke me.”</i>
</p>

<p>
After this empty imagining, it happened on a day,
as I sat thoughtful, that I was taken with such a
strong trembling at the heart, that it could not have
been otherwise in the presence of my lady. Whereupon
I perceived that there was an appearance of
Love beside me, and I seemed to see him coming
from my lady; and he said, not aloud but within
my heart: “Now take heed that thou bless the day
when I entered into thee; for it is fitting that thou
shouldst do so.” And with that my heart was so
full of gladness, that I could hardly believe it to be
of very truth mine own heart and not another.
</p>

<p>
A short while after these words which my heart
spoke to me with the tongue of Love, I saw coming
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>towards me a certain lady who was very famous
for her beauty, and of whom that friend whom I
have already called the first among my friends had
long been enamoured. This lady’s right name was
Joan; but because of her comeliness (or at least it
was so imagined) she was called of many <i>Primavera</i>
(Spring), and went by that name among them. Then
looking again, I perceived that the most noble Beatrice
followed after her. And when both these ladies
had passed by me, it seemed to me that Love spake
again in my heart, saying: “She that came first
was called Spring, only because of that which was
to happen on this day. And it was I myself who
caused that name to be given her; seeing that as
the Spring cometh first in the year, so should she
come first on this day,<a class="tag" id="tag21" href="#note21">[21]</a> when Beatrice was to show
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>herself after the vision of her servant. And even
if thou go about to consider her right name, it
is also as one should say, ‘She shall come first;’
inasmuch as her name, Joan, is taken from that
John who went before the True Light, saying:
‘<i>Ego vox clamantis in deserto: Parate viam
Domini.</i>’”<a class="tag" id="tag22" href="#note22">[22]</a> And also it seemed to me that he
added other words, to wit: “He who should
inquire delicately touching this matter, could not
but call Beatrice by mine own name, which is
to say, Love; beholding her so like unto me.”
</p>

<p>
Then I, having thought of this, imagined to write
it with rhymes and send it unto my chief friend;
but setting aside certain words<a class="tag" id="tag23" href="#note23">[23]</a> which seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>proper to be set aside, because I believed that his
heart still regarded the beauty of her that was
called Spring.
</p>

<p>
And I wrote this sonnet:—
</p>

<div class="poem"><p>I felt a spirit of love begin to stir</p>
<p class="i2">  Within my heart, long time unfelt till then;</p>
<p class="i2">  And saw Love coming towards me, fair and fain</p>
<p>(That I scarce knew him for his joyful cheer),</p>
<p>Saying, “Be now indeed my worshipper!”</p>
<p class="i2">  And in his speech he laugh’d and laugh’d again.</p>
<p class="i2">  Then, while it was his pleasure to remain,</p>
<p>I chanced to look the way he had drawn near,</p>
<p>And saw the Ladies Joan and Beatrice</p>
<p class="i2">  Approach me, this the other following,</p>
<p class="i4">    One and a second marvel instantly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>And even as now my memory speaketh this,</p>
<p class="i2">  Love spake it then: “The first is christen’d Spring;</p>
<p class="i4">    The second Love, she is so like to me.”</p></div>

<p>
<i>This sonnet has many parts: whereof the first
tells how I felt awakened within my heart the
accustomed tremor, and how it seemed that Love
appeared to me joyful from afar. The second says
how it appeared to me that Love spake within my
heart, and what was his aspect. The third tells
how, after he had in such wise been with me a space,
I saw and heard certain things. The second part
begins here, “Saying, ‘Be now;’” the third here,
“Then, while it was his pleasure.” The third part
divides into two. In the first, I say what I saw.
In the second, I say what I heard; and it begins
here, “Love spake it then.”</i>
</p>

<p>
It might be here objected unto me, (and even
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>by one worthy of controversy,) that I have spoken
of Love as though it were a thing outward and
visible: not only a spiritual essence, but as a
bodily substance also. The which thing, in absolute
truth, is a fallacy; Love not being of itself a
substance, but an accident of substance. Yet that
I speak of Love as though it were a thing
tangible and even human, appears by three things
which I say thereof. And firstly, I say that I
perceived Love coming towards me; whereby,
seeing that <i>to come</i> bespeaks locomotion, and
seeing also how philosophy teacheth us that none
but a corporeal substance hath locomotion, it
seemeth that I speak of Love as of a corporeal
substance. And secondly, I say that Love smiled:
and thirdly, that Love spake; faculties (and
especially the risible faculty) which appear proper
unto man: whereby it further seemeth that I
speak of Love as of a man. Now that this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>matter may be explained (as is fitting), it must
first be remembered that anciently they who
wrote poems of Love wrote not in the vulgar
tongue, but rather certain poets in the Latin
tongue. I mean, among us, although perchance
the same may have been among others, and
although likewise, as among the Greeks, they
were not writers of spoken language, but men
of letters, treated of these things.<a class="tag" id="tag24" href="#note24">[24]</a> And indeed
it is not a great number of years since poetry
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>began to be made in the vulgar tongue; the
writing of rhymes in spoken language corresponding
to the writing in metre of Latin verse, by a
certain analogy. And I say that it is but a little
while, because if we examine the language of <i>oco</i>
and the language of <i>sì</i>,<a class="tag" id="tag25" href="#note25">[25]</a> we shall not find in
those tongues any written thing of an earlier date
than the last hundred and fifty years. Also the
reason why certain of a very mean sort obtained
at the first some fame as poets is, that before
them no man had written verses in the language
of <i>sì</i>: and of these, the first was moved to the
writing of such verses by the wish to make
himself understood of a certain lady, unto whom
Latin poetry was difficult. This thing is against
such as rhyme concerning other matters than love;
that mode of speech having been first used for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>the expression of love alone.<a class="tag" id="tag26" href="#note26">[26]</a> Wherefore, seeing
that poets have a license allowed them that is not
allowed unto the writers of prose, and seeing
also that they who write in rhyme are simply
poets in the vulgar tongue, it becomes fitting and
reasonable that a larger license should be given
to these than to other modern writers; and that
any metaphor or rhetorical similitude which is
permitted unto poets, should also be counted not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>unseemly in the rhymers of the vulgar tongue.
Thus, if we perceive that the former have caused
inanimate things to speak as though they had
sense and reason, and to discourse one with
another; yea, and not only actual things, but such
also as have no real existence, (seeing that they
have made things which are not, to speak; and
oftentimes written of those which are merely
accidents as though they were substances and
things human); it should therefore be permitted to
the latter to do the like; which is to say, not
inconsiderately, but with such sufficient motive
as may afterwards be set forth in prose.
</p>

<p>
That the Latin poets have done thus, appears
through Virgil, where he saith that Juno (to wit,
a goddess hostile to the Trojans) spake unto
Æolus, master of the Winds; as it is written in
the first book of the Æneid, <i>Æole, namque tibi,
etc.</i>; and that this master of the Winds made
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>reply: <i>Tuus, o regina, quid optes—Explorare labor,
mihi jussa capessere fas est.</i> And through the
same poet, the inanimate thing speaketh unto the
animate, in the third book of the Æneid, where it
is written: <i>Dardanidæ duri, etc.</i> With Lucan, the
animate thing speaketh to the inanimate; as thus:
<i>Multum, Roma, tamen debes civilibus armis.</i> In
Horace, man is made to speak to his own intelligence
as unto another person; (and not only
hath Horace done this, but herein he followeth the
excellent Homer), as thus in his Poetics: <i>Dic mihi,
Musa, virum, etc.</i> Through Ovid, Love speaketh
as a human creature, in the beginning of his
discourse <i>De Remediis Amoris</i>: as thus: <i>Bella
mihi, video, bella parantur, ait.</i> By which
ensamples this thing shall be made manifest
unto such as may be offended at any part of this
my book. And lest some of the common sort
should be moved to jeering hereat, I will here
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>add, that neither did these ancient poets speak
thus without consideration, nor should they who
are makers of rhyme in our day write after
the same fashion, having no reason in what they
write; for it were a shameful thing if one should
rhyme under the semblance of metaphor or rhetorical
similitude, and afterwards, being questioned
thereof, should be unable to rid his words of such
semblance, unto their right understanding. Of whom,
(to wit, of such as rhyme thus foolishly,) myself
and the first among my friends do know many.
</p>

<p>
But returning to the matter of my discourse. This
excellent lady, of whom I spake in what hath gone
before, came at last into such favour with all men,
that when she passed anywhere folk ran to behold
her; which thing was a deep joy to me: and
when she drew near unto any, so much truth and
simpleness entered into his heart, that he dared neither
to lift his eyes nor to return her salutation:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>and unto this, many who have felt it can bear
witness. She went along crowned and clothed
with humility, showing no whit of pride in all
that she heard and saw: and when she had gone
by, it was said of many, “This is not a woman,
but one of the beautiful angels of Heaven:” and
there were some that said: “This is surely a
miracle; blessed be the Lord, who hath power to
work thus marvellously.” I say, of very sooth,
that she showed herself so gentle and so full of
all perfection, that she bred in those who looked
upon her a soothing quiet beyond any speech;
neither could any look upon her without sighing
immediately. These things, and things yet more
wonderful, were brought to pass through her
miraculous virtue. Wherefore I, considering thereof
and wishing to resume the endless tale of her
praises, resolved to write somewhat wherein I might
dwell on her surpassing influence; to the end that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>not only they who had beheld her, but others also,
might know as much concerning her as words could
give to the understanding. And it was then that I
wrote this sonnet:—
</p>

<div class="poem"><p>My lady looks so gentle and so pure</p>
<p class="i2">  When yielding salutation by the way,</p>
<p class="i2">  That the tongue trembles and has nought to say,</p>
<p>And the eyes, which fain would see, may not endure.</p>
<p>And still, amid the praise she hears secure,</p>
<p class="i2">  She walks with humbleness for her array;</p>
<p class="i2">  Seeming a creature sent from Heaven to stay</p>
<p>On earth, and show a miracle made sure.</p>
<p>She is so pleasant in the eyes of men</p>
<p>That through the sight the inmost heart doth gain</p>
<p class="i2">  A sweetness which needs proof to know it by:</p>
<p>And from between her lips there seems to move</p>
<p>A soothing essence that is full of love,</p>
<p class="i2">  Saying for ever to the spirit, “Sigh!”</p></div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
This sonnet is so easy to understand, from what
is afore narrated, that it needs no division; and
therefore, leaving it, I say also that this excellent
lady came into such favour with all men, that not
only she herself was honoured and commended,
but through her companionship, honour and commendation
came unto others. Wherefore I,
perceiving this, and wishing that it should also
be made manifest to those that beheld it not,
wrote the sonnet here following; wherein is
signified the power which her virtue had upon
other ladies:—
</p>

<div class="poem"><p>For certain he hath seen all perfectness</p>
<p class="i2">  Who among other ladies hath seen mine:</p>
<p class="i2">  They that go with her humbly should combine</p>
<p>To thank their God for such peculiar grace.</p>
<p>So perfect is the beauty of her face</p>
<p class="i2">  That it begets in no wise any sign</p>
<p class="i2">  Of envy, but draws round her a clear line</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>Of love, and blessed faith, and gentleness.</p>
<p>Merely the sight of her makes all things bow:</p>
<p class="i2">  Not she herself alone is holier</p>
<p class="i4">    Than all; but hers, through her, are raised above.</p>
<p>From all her acts such lovely graces flow</p>
<p class="i2">  That truly one may never think of her</p>
<p class="i4">    Without a passion of exceeding love.</p></div>

<p>
<i>This sonnet has three parts. In the first, I say in
what company this lady appeared most wondrous.
In the second, I say how gracious was her society.
In the third, I tell of the things which she, with
power, worked upon others. The second begins here,
“They that go with her;” the third here, “So
perfect.” This last part divides into three. In the
first, I tell what she operated upon women, that is,
by their own faculties. In the second, I tell what
she operated in them through others. In the third,
I say how she not only operated in women, but in</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span><i>all people; and not only while herself present, but,
by memory of her, operated wondrously. The second
begins here, “Merely the sight;” the third here,
“From all her acts.”</i>
</p>

<p>
Thereafter on a day, I began to consider that
which I had said of my lady: to wit, in these two
sonnets aforegone: and becoming aware that I had
not spoken of her immediate effect on me at that
especial time, it seemed to me that I had spoken
defectively. Whereupon I resolved to write somewhat
of the manner wherein I was then subject
to her influence, and of what her influence then
was. And conceiving that I should not be able to
say these things in the small compass of a sonnet,
I began therefore a poem with this beginning:—
</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Love hath so long possessed me for his own</p>
<p class="i2">  And made his lordship so familiar</p>
<p>That he, who at first irked me, is now grown</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>
<p class="i2">  Unto my heart as its best secrets are.</p>
<p class="i2">  And thus, when he in such sore wise doth mar</p>
<p>My life that all its strength seems gone from it,</p>
<p>Mine inmost being then feels throughly quit</p>
<p class="i2">  Of anguish, and all evil keeps afar.</p>
<p>Love also gathers to such power in me</p>
<p class="i2">  That my sighs speak, each one a grievous thing,</p>
<p class="i2">  Always soliciting</p>
<p>My lady’s salutation piteously.</p>
<p>Whenever she beholds me, it is so,</p>
<p>Who is more sweet than any words can show.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="astline i2">
 ******
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="astline i2">

</p></div></div>

<p>
<i>Quomodo sedet sola civitas plena populo! facta
est quasi vidua domina gentium!</i><a class="tag" id="tag27" href="#note27">[27]</a>
</p>

<p>
I was still occupied with this poem, (having
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>composed thereof only the above-written stanza,)
when the Lord God of justice called my most
gracious lady unto Himself, that she might be
glorious under the banner of that blessed Queen
Mary, whose name had always a deep reverence in
the words of holy Beatrice. And because haply it
might be found good that I should say somewhat
concerning her departure, I will herein declare
what are the reasons which make that I shall not
do so.
</p>

<p>
And the reasons are three. The first is, that
such matter belongeth not of right to the present
argument, if one consider the opening of this
little book. The second is, that even though the
present argument required it, my pen doth not
suffice to write in a fit manner of this thing. And the
third is, that were it both possible and of absolute
necessity, it would still be unseemly for me to
speak thereof, seeing that thereby it must behove
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>me to speak also mine own praises: a thing that
in whosoever doeth it is worthy of blame. For the
which reasons, I will leave this matter to be treated
of by some other than myself.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, as the number nine, which number
hath often had mention in what hath gone before,
(and not, as it might appear, without reason,) seems
also to have borne a part in the manner of her
death: it is therefore right that I should say
somewhat thereof. And for this cause, having first
said what was the part it bore herein, I will afterwards
point out a reason which made that this
number was so closely allied unto my lady.
</p>

<p>
I say, then, that according to the division of time
in Italy, her most noble spirit departed from among
us in the first hour of the ninth day of the month;
and according to the division of time in Syria, in
the ninth month of the year: seeing that Tismim,
which with us is October, is there the first month.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>Also she was taken from among us in that year of
our reckoning (to wit, of the years of our Lord) in
which the perfect number was nine times multiplied
within that century wherein she was born into the
world: which is to say, the thirteenth century of
Christians.<a class="tag" id="tag28" href="#note28">[28]</a>
</p>

<p>
And touching the reason why this number was so
closely allied unto her, it may peradventure be this.
According to Ptolemy (and also to the Christian
verity), the revolving heavens are nine; and according
to the common opinion among astrologers, these
nine heavens together have influence over the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>earth. Wherefore it would appear that this number
was thus allied unto her for the purpose of signifying
that, at her birth, all these nine heavens were at
perfect unity with each other as to their influence.
This is one reason that may be brought: but more
narrowly considering, and according to the infallible
truth, this number was her own self: that is to
say, by similitude. As thus. The number three is
the root of the number nine; seeing that without
the interposition of any other number, being
multiplied merely by itself, it produceth nine, as
we manifestly perceive that three times three are
nine. Thus, three being of itself the efficient of nine,
and the Great Efficient of Miracles being of Himself
Three Persons (to wit: the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Spirit), which, being Three, are also One:—this
lady was accompanied by the number nine
to the end that men might clearly perceive her to
be a nine, that is, a miracle, whose only root is the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>Holy Trinity. It may be that a more subtile person
would find for this thing a reason of greater subtilty:
but such is the reason that I find, and that liketh
me best.
</p>

<p>
After this most gracious creature had gone out
from among us, the whole city came to be as it were
widowed and despoiled of all dignity. Then I, left
mourning in this desolate city, wrote unto the
principal persons thereof, in an epistle, concerning
its condition; taking for my commencement
those words of Jeremias: <i>Quomodo sedet sola
civitas! etc.</i> And I make mention of this, that
none may marvel wherefore I set down these words
before, in beginning to treat of her death. Also
if any should blame me, in that I do not transcribe
that epistle whereof I have spoken, I will make
it mine excuse that I began this little book with
the intent that it should be written altogether in
the vulgar tongue; wherefore, seeing that the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>epistle I speak of is in Latin, it belongeth not to mine
undertaking: more especially as I know that my
chief friend, for whom I write this book, wished also
that the whole of it should be in the vulgar tongue.
</p>

<p>
When mine eyes had wept for some while, until
they were so weary with weeping that I could no
longer through them give ease to my sorrow, I
bethought me that a few mournful words might
stand me instead of tears. And therefore I proposed
to make a poem, that weeping I might speak therein
of her for whom so much sorrow had destroyed my
spirit; and I then began “The eyes that weep.”
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
<i>That this poem may seem to remain the more
widowed at its close, I will divide it before writing
it; and this method I will observe henceforward.
I say that this poor little poem has three parts. The
first is a prelude. In the second, I speak of her.
In the third, I speak pitifully to the poem. The
second begins here, “Beatrice is gone up;” the third</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span><i>here, “Weep, pitiful Song of mine.” The first
divides into three. In the first, I say what moves
me to speak. In the second, I say to whom I mean
to speak. In the third, I say of whom I mean to
speak. The second begins here, “And because often,
thinking;” the third here, “And I will say.” Then,
when I say, “Beatrice is gone up,” I speak of her;
and concerning this I have two parts. First, I
tell the cause why she was taken away from us:
afterwards, I say how one weeps her parting; and
this part commences here, “Wonderfully.” This
part divides into three. In the first, I say who it
is that weeps her not. In the second, I say who it
is that doth weep her. In the third, I speak of
my condition. The second begins here, “But sighing
comes, and grief;” the third, “With sighs.”
Then, when I say, “Weep, pitiful Song of mine,”
I speak to this my song, telling it what ladies to
go to, and stay with.</i>

After I had written this poem, I received the
visit of a friend whom I counted as second unto
me in the degrees of friendship, and who, moreover,
had been united by the nearest kindred to
that most gracious creature. And when we had a
little spoken together, he began to solicit me that
I would write somewhat in memory of a lady
who had died; and he disguised his speech, so
as to seem to be speaking of another who was
but lately dead: wherefore I, perceiving that his
speech was of none other than that blessed one
herself, told him that it should be done as he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>required. Then afterwards, having thought thereof,
I imagined to give vent in a sonnet to some part
of my hidden lamentations; but in such sort that
it might seem to be spoken by this friend of
mine, to whom I was to give it. And the sonnet
saith thus: “Stay now with me,” etc.
</p>

<p>
<i>This sonnet has two parts. In the first, I call
the Faithful of Love to hear me. In the second, I
relate my miserable condition. The second begins
here, “Mark how they force.”</i>
</p>

<div class="poem"><p>Stay now with me, and listen to my sighs,</p>
<p class="i2">  Ye piteous hearts, as pity bids ye do.</p>
<p class="i2">  Mark how they force their way out and press through;</p>
<p>If they be once pent up, the whole life dies.</p>
<p>Seeing that now indeed my weary eyes</p>
<p class="i2">  Oftener refuse than I can tell to you</p>
<p class="i2">  (Even though my endless grief is ever new),</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>To weep and let the smothered anguish rise.</p>
<p>Also in sighing ye shall hear me call</p>
<p class="i2">  On her whose blessèd presence doth enrich</p>
<p class="i4">    The only home that well befitteth her:</p>
<p>And ye shall hear a bitter scorn of all</p>
<p class="i2">  Sent from the inmost of my spirit in speech</p>
<p class="i4">    That mourns its joy and its joy’s minister.</p></div>

<p>
But when I had written this sonnet, bethinking
me who he was to whom I was to give it, that
it might appear to be his speech, it seemed to
me that this was but a poor and barren gift for
one of her so near kindred. Wherefore, before
giving him this sonnet, I wrote two stanzas of
a poem: the first being written in very sooth as
though it were spoken by him, but the other
being mine own speech, albeit, unto one who
should not look closely, they would both seem
to be said by the same person. Nevertheless,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>looking closely, one must perceive that it is not
so, inasmuch as one does not call this most gracious
creature <i>his lady</i>, and the other does, as is manifestly
apparent. And I gave the poem and the
sonnet unto my friend, saying that I had made
them only for him.
</p>

<p>
<i>The poem begins, “Whatever while,” and has two
parts. In the first, that is, in the first stanza, this
my dear friend, her kinsman, laments. In the second,
I lament; that is, in the other stanza, which begins,
“For ever.” And thus it appears that in this poem
two persons lament, of whom one laments as a
brother, the other as a servant.</i>
</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Whatever while the thought comes over me</p>
<p class="i2">  That I may not again</p>
<p class="i4">    Behold that lady whom I mourn for now,</p>
<p>About my heart my mind brings constantly</p>
<p class="i2">  So much of extreme pain</p>
<p class="i4"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>    That I say, Soul of mine, why stayest thou?</p>
<p class="i4">    Truly the anguish, Soul, that we must bow</p>
<p>Beneath, until we win out of this life,</p>
<p class="i2">  Gives me full oft a fear that trembleth:</p>
<p class="i2">  So that I call on Death</p>
<p>Even as on Sleep one calleth after strife,</p>
<p class="i2">  Saying, Come unto me. Life showeth grim</p>
<p class="i2">  And bare; and if one dies, I envy him.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>For ever, among all my sighs which burn,</p>
<p class="i2">  There is a piteous speech</p>
<p class="i4">    That clamours upon death continually:</p>
<p>Yea, unto him doth my whole spirit turn</p>
<p class="i2">  Since first his hand did reach</p>
<p class="i4">    My lady’s life with most foul cruelty.</p>
<p class="i4">    But from the height of woman’s fairness, she,</p>
<p>Going up from us with the joy we had,</p>
<p class="i2">  Grew perfectly and spiritually fair;</p>
<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>  That so she spreads even there</p>
<p>A light of Love which makes the Angels glad,</p>
<p class="i2">  And even unto their subtle minds can bring</p>
<p class="i2">  A certain awe of profound marvelling.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
On that day which fulfilled the year since my
lady had been made of the citizens of eternal
life, remembering me of her as I sat alone, I
betook myself to draw the resemblance of an
angel upon certain tablets. And while I did thus,
chancing to turn my head, I perceived that some
were standing beside me to whom I should have
given courteous welcome, and that they were observing
what I did: also I learned afterwards that
they had been there a while before I perceived
them. Perceiving whom, I arose for salutation,
and said: “Another was with me.”<a class="tag" id="tag29" href="#note29">[29]</a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
Afterwards, when they had left me, I set myself
again to mine occupation, to wit, to the drawing
figures of angels: in doing which, I conceived to
write of this matter in rhyme, as for her anniversary,
and to address my rhymes unto those
who had just left me. It was then that I wrote
the sonnet which saith, “That lady;” and as
this sonnet hath two commencements, it behoveth
me to divide it with both of them here.
</p>

<p>
<i>I say that, according to the first, this sonnet has
three parts. In the first, I say that this lady was
then in my memory. In the second, I tell what
Love therefore did with me. In the third, I speak
of the effects of Love. The second begins here, “Love
knowing;” the third here, “Forth went they.”
This part divides into two. In the one, I say that all
my sighs issued speaking. In the other, I say how
some spoke certain words different from the others.
The second begins here, “And still.” In this same</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span><i>manner is it divided with the other beginning, save
that, in the first part, I tell when this lady had thus
come into my mind, and this I say not in the other.</i>
</p>

<div class="poem"><p>That lady of all gentle memories</p>
<p class="i2">  Had lighted on my soul;—whose new abode</p>
<p class="i2">  Lies now, as it was well ordained of God,</p>
<p>Among the poor in heart, where Mary is.</p>
<p>Love, knowing that dear image to be his,</p>
<p class="i2">  Woke up within the sick heart sorrow-bow’d,</p>
<p class="i2">  Unto the sighs which are its weary load</p>
<p>Saying, “Go forth.” And they went forth, I wis;</p>
<p>Forth went they from my breast that throbbed and ached;</p>
<p class="i2">  With such a pang as oftentimes will bathe</p>
<p class="i4">    Mine eyes with tears when I am left alone.</p>
<p class="i2">  And still those sighs which drew the heaviest breath</p>
<p>Came whispering thus: “O noble intellect!</p>
<p class="i4">    It is a year to-day that thou art gone.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p class="center large">
<span class="smcap">Second Commencement.</span>
</p>

<div class="poem"><p>That lady of all gentle memories</p>
<p class="i2">  Had lighted on my soul;—for whose sake flow’d</p>
<p class="i2">  The tears of Love; in whom the power abode</p>
<p>Which led you to observe while I did this.</p>
<p>Love, knowing that dear image to be his, etc.</p></div>

<p>
Then, having sat for some space sorely in thought
because of the time that was now past, I was so
filled with dolorous imaginings that it became
outwardly manifest in mine altered countenance.
Whereupon, feeling this and being in dread lest
any should have seen me, I lifted mine eyes to
look; and then perceived a young and very beautiful
lady, who was gazing upon me from a window with
a gaze full of pity, so that the very sum of pity
appeared gathered together in her. And seeing that
unhappy persons, when they beget compassion in
others, are then most moved unto weeping, as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>though they also felt pity for themselves, it came to
pass that mine eyes began to be inclined unto tears.
Wherefore, becoming fearful lest I should make
manifest mine abject condition, I rose up, and went
where I could not be seen of that lady; saying afterwards
within myself: “Certainly with her also must
abide most noble Love.” And with that, I resolved
upon writing a sonnet, wherein, speaking unto her, I
should say all that I have just said. And as this
sonnet is very evident, I will not divide it:—
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Mine eyes beheld the blessed pity spring</p>
<p class="i2">  Into thy countenance immediately</p>
<p class="i2">  A while agone, when thou beheldst in me</p>
<p>The sickness only hidden grief can bring;</p>
<p>And then I knew thou wast considering</p>
<p class="i2">  How abject and forlorn my life must be;</p>
<p class="i2">  And I became afraid that thou shouldst see</p>
<p>My weeping, and account it a base thing.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>Therefore I went out from thee; feeling how</p>
<p class="i2">  The tears were straightway loosened at my heart</p>
<p class="i4">    Beneath thine eyes’ compassionate control.</p>
<p class="i4">    And afterwards I said within my soul:</p>
<p class="i2">  “Lo! with this lady dwells the counterpart</p>
<p>Of the same Love who holds me weeping now.”</p>
</div>

<p>
It happened after this, that whensoever I was
seen of this lady, she became pale and of a piteous
countenance, as though it had been with love;
whereby she remembered me many times of my
own most noble lady, who was wont to be of a like
paleness. And I know that often, when I could
not weep nor in any way give ease unto mine anguish,
I went to look upon this lady, who seemed to bring
the tears into my eyes by the mere sight of her.
Of the which thing I bethought me to speak unto
her in rhyme, and then made this sonnet: which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>begins, “Love’s pallor,” and which is plain without
being divided, by its exposition aforesaid:—
</p>

<div class="poem"><p>Love’s pallor and the semblance of deep ruth</p>
<p class="i2">  Were never yet shown forth so perfectly</p>
<p class="i2">  In any lady’s face, chancing to see</p>
<p>Grief’s miserable countenance uncouth,</p>
<p>As in thine, lady, they have sprung to soothe,</p>
<p class="i2">  When in mine anguish thou hast looked on me;</p>
<p class="i2">  Until sometimes it seems as if, through thee,</p>
<p>My heart might almost wander from its truth.</p>
<p>Yet so it is, I cannot hold mine eyes</p>
<p class="i2">  From gazing very often upon thine</p>
<p class="i4">    In the sore hope to shed those tears they keep;</p>
<p>And at such time, thou mak’st the pent tears rise</p>
<p class="i2">  Even to the brim, till the eyes waste and pine;</p>
<p class="i4">    Yet cannot they, while thou art present, weep.</p></div>

<p>
At length, by the constant sight of this lady, mine
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>eyes began to be gladdened overmuch with her
company; through which thing many times I had
much unrest, and rebuked myself as a base person:
also, many times I cursed the unsteadfastness of mine
eyes, and said to them inwardly: “Was not your
grievous condition of weeping wont one while to
make others weep? And will ye now forget this
thing because a lady looketh upon you? who so
looketh merely in compassion of the grief ye then
showed for your own blessed lady. But whatso ye
can, that do ye, accursed eyes! many a time will
I make you remember it! for never, till death dry
you up, should ye make an end of your weeping.”
And when I had spoken thus unto mine eyes, I
was taken again with extreme and grievous sighing.
And to the end that this inward strife which I had
undergone might not be hidden from all saving the
miserable wretch who endured it, I proposed to
write a sonnet, and to comprehend in it this horrible
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>condition. And I wrote this which begins, “The
very bitter weeping.”
</p>

<p>
<i>The sonnet has two parts. In the first, I speak
to my eyes, as my heart spoke within myself. In the
second, I remove a difficulty, showing who it is that
speaks thus: and this part begins here, “So far.”
It well might receive other divisions also; but this
would be useless, since it is manifest by the preceding
exposition.</i>
</p>

<div class="poem"><p>“The very bitter weeping that ye made</p>
<p class="i2">  So long a time together, eyes of mine,</p>
<p class="i2">  Was wont to make the tears of pity shine</p>
<p>In other eyes full oft, as I have said.</p>
<p>But now this thing were scarce rememberèd</p>
<p class="i2">  If I, on my part, foully would combine</p>
<p class="i2">  With you, and not recall each ancient sign</p>
<p>Of grief, and her for whom your tears were shed</p>
<p>It is your fickleness that doth betray</p>
<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>  My mind to fears, and makes me tremble thus</p>
<p class="i4">    What while a lady greets me with her eyes.</p>
<p>Except by death, we must not any way</p>
<p class="i2">  Forget our lady who is gone from us.”</p>
<p class="i4">    So far doth my heart utter, and then sighs.</p></div>

<p>
The sight of this lady brought me into so unwonted
a condition that I often thought of her as
of one too dear unto me; and I began to consider
her thus: “This lady is young, beautiful, gentle,
and wise; perchance it was Love himself who set
her in my path, that so my life might find peace.”
And there were times when I thought yet more
fondly, until my heart consented unto its reasoning.
But when it had so consented, my thought would
often turn round upon me, as moved by reason,
and cause me to say within myself: “What hope
is this which would console me after so base a
fashion, and which hath taken the place of all other
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>imagining?” Also there was another voice within
me, that said: “And wilt thou, having suffered so
much tribulation through Love, not escape while
yet thou mayst from so much bitterness? Thou
must surely know that this thought carries with it
the desire of Love, and drew its life from the
gentle eyes of that lady who vouchsafed thee so
much pity.” Wherefore I, having striven sorely and
very often with myself, bethought me to say somewhat
thereof in rhyme. And seeing that in the battle
of doubts, the victory most often remained with
such as inclined towards the lady of whom I speak,
it seemed to me that I should address this sonnet
unto her: in the first line whereof, I call that
thought which spake of her a gentle thought, only
because it spoke of one who was gentle; being of
itself most vile.<a class="tag" id="tag30" href="#note30">[30]</a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
<i>In this sonnet I make myself into two, according
as my thoughts were divided, one from the other.
The one part I call Heart, that is, appetite; the
other, Soul, that is, reason; and I tell what one
saith to the other. And that it is fitting to call the
appetite Heart, and the reason Soul, is manifest
enough to them to whom I wish this to be open.
True it is that, in the preceding sonnet, I take the
part of the Heart against the Eyes; and that appears
contrary to what I say in the present; and therefore
I say that, there also, by the Heart I mean appetite,
because yet greater was my desire to remember my</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span><i>most gentle lady than to see this other, although
indeed I had some appetite towards her, but it appeared
slight: wherefrom it appears that the one
statement is not contrary to the other. This sonnet
has three parts. In the first, I begin to say to this
lady how my desires turn all towards her. In the
second, I say how the Soul, that is, the reason, speaks
to the Heart, that is, to the appetite. In the third,
I say how the latter answers. The second begins
here, “And what is this?” the third here, “And
the heart answers.”</i>
</p>

<div class="poem"><p>A gentle thought there is will often start,</p>
<p class="i2">  Within my secret self, to speech of thee:</p>
<p class="i2">  Also of Love it speaks so tenderly</p>
<p>That much in me consents and takes its part.</p>
<p>“And what is this,” the soul saith to the heart,</p>
<p class="i2">  “That cometh thus to comfort thee and me,</p>
<p class="i2">  And thence where it would dwell, thus potently</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>Can drive all other thoughts by its strange art?”</p>
<p>And the heart answers: “Be no more at strife</p>
<p class="i2">  ’Twixt doubt and doubt: this is Love’s messenger</p>
<p class="i4">    And speaketh but his words, from him received;</p>
<p>And all the strength it owns and all the life</p>
<p class="i2">  It draweth from the gentle eyes of her</p>
<p class="i4">    Who, looking on our grief, hath often grieved.”</p></div>

<p>
But against this adversary of reason, there rose
up in me on a certain day, about the ninth hour,
a strong visible phantasy, wherein I seemed to behold
the most gracious Beatrice, habited in that crimson
raiment which she had worn when I had first beheld
her; also she appeared to me of the same tender
age as then. Whereupon I fell into a deep thought
of her: and my memory ran back, according to the
order of time, unto all those matters in the which
she had borne a part; and my heart began painfully
to repent of the desire by which it had so basely
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>let itself be possessed during so many days, contrary
to the constancy of reason.
</p>

<p>
And then, this evil desire being quite gone from
me, all my thoughts turned again unto their excellent
Beatrice. And I say most truly that from that hour
I thought constantly of her with the whole humbled
and ashamed heart; the which became often manifest
in sighs, that had among them the name of that
most gracious creature, and how she departed from
us. Also it would come to pass very often, through
the bitter anguish of some one thought, that I forgot
both it, and myself, and where I was. By this
increase of sighs, my weeping, which before had
been somewhat lessened, increased in like manner;
so that mine eyes seemed to long only for tears
and to cherish them, and came at last to be circled
about with red as though they had suffered martyrdom:
neither were they able to look again upon
the beauty of any face that might again bring them
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>to shame and evil: from which things it will appear
that they were fitly guerdoned for their unsteadfastness.
Wherefore I, (wishing that mine abandonment
of all such evil desires and vain temptations should
be certified and made manifest, beyond all doubts
which might have been suggested by the rhymes
aforewritten) proposed to write a sonnet wherein I
should express this purport. And I then wrote,
“Woe’s me!”
</p>

<p>
<i>I said, “Woe’s me!” because I was ashamed of the
trifling of mine eyes. This sonnet I do not divide,
since its purport is manifest enough.</i>
</p>

<div class="poem"><p>Woe’s me! by dint of all these sighs that come</p>
<p class="i2">  Forth of my heart, its endless grief to prove,</p>
<p class="i2">  Mine eyes are conquered, so that even to move</p>
<p>Their lids for greeting is grown troublesome.</p>
<p>They wept so long that now they are grief’s home,</p>
<p class="i2">  And count their tears all laughter far above:</p>
<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>  They wept till they are circled now by Love</p>
<p>With a red circle in sign of martyrdom.</p>
<p>These musings, and the sighs they bring from me,</p>
<p class="i2">  Are grown at last so constant and so sore</p>
<p class="i4">    That love swoons in my spirit with faint breath;</p>
<p>Hearing in those sad sounds continually</p>
<p class="i2">  The most sweet name that my dead lady bore,</p>
<p class="i4">    With many grievous words touching her death.</p></div>

<p>
About this time, it happened that a great number
of persons undertook a pilgrimage, to the end that
they might behold that blessed portraiture bequeathed
unto us by our Lord Jesus Christ as the image of
His beautiful countenance,<a class="tag" id="tag31" href="#note31">[31]</a> (upon which countenance
my dear lady now looketh continually). And certain
among these pilgrims, who seemed very thoughtful,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>passed by a path which is well-nigh in the midst of
the city where my most gracious lady was born,
and abode, and at last died.
</p>

<p>
Then I, beholding them, said within myself:
“These pilgrims seem to be come from very
far; and I think they cannot have heard speak of
this lady, or know anything concerning her. Their
thoughts are not of her, but of other things; it may
be, of their friends who are far distant, and whom
we, in our turn, know not.” And I went on to say:
“I know that if they were of a country near unto
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>us, they would in some wise seem disturbed, passing
through this city which is so full of grief.” And I
said also: “If I could speak with them a space,
I am certain that I should make them weep before
they went forth of this city; for those things that
they would hear from me must needs beget weeping
in any.”
</p>

<p>
And when the last of them had gone by me, I
bethought me to write a sonnet, showing forth
mine inward speech; and that it might seem the
more pitiful, I made as though I had spoken it indeed
unto them. And I wrote this sonnet, which
beginneth: “Ye pilgrim-folk.” I made use of the
word <i>pilgrim</i> for its general signification; for
“pilgrim” may be understood in two senses, one
general, and one special. General, so far as any
man may be called a pilgrim who leaveth the
place of his birth; whereas, more narrowly speaking,
he only is a pilgrim who goeth towards or frowards
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>the House of St. James. For there are three
separate denominations proper unto those who
undertake journeys to the glory of God. They
are called Palmers who go beyond the seas eastward,
whence often they bring palm-branches. And
Pilgrims, as I have said, are they who journey
unto the holy House of Gallicia; seeing that no
other apostle was buried so far from his birthplace
as was the blessed Saint James. And there is a
third sort who are called Romers; in that they go
whither these whom I have called pilgrims went:
which is to say, unto Rome.
</p>

<p>
<i>This sonnet is not divided, because its own words
sufficiently declare it.</i>
</p>

<div class="poem"><p>Ye pilgrim-folk, advancing pensively</p>
<p class="i2">  As if in thought of distant things, I pray,</p>
<p class="i2">  Is your own land indeed so far away—</p>
<p>As by your aspect it would seem to be—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>That this our heavy sorrow leaves you free</p>
<p class="i2">  Though passing through the mournful town midway;</p>
<p class="i2">  Like unto men that understand to-day</p>
<p>Nothing at all of her great misery?</p>
<p>Yet if ye will but stay, whom I accost,</p>
<p class="i2">  And listen to my words a little space,</p>
<p class="i4">    At going ye shall mourn with a loud voice.</p>
<p>It is her Beatrice that she hath lost;</p>
<p class="i2">  Of whom the least word spoken holds such grace</p>
<p class="i4">    That men weep hearing it, and have no choice.</p></div>

<p>
A while after these things, two gentle ladies sent
unto me, praying that I would bestow upon them
certain of these my rhymes. And I (taking into
account their worthiness and consideration) resolved
that I would write also a new thing, and send it
them together with those others, to the end that
their wishes might be more honourably fulfilled.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>Therefore I made a sonnet, which narrates my condition,
and which I caused to be conveyed to them,
accompanied by the one preceding, and with that
other which begins, “Stay now with me and listen
to my sighs.” And the new sonnet is, “Beyond
the sphere.”
</p>

<p>
<i>This sonnet comprises five parts. In the first, I
tell whither my thought goeth, naming the place by
the name of one of its effects. In the second, I say
wherefore it goeth up, and who makes it go thus.
In the third, I tell what it saw, namely, a lady
honoured. And I then call it a “Pilgrim Spirit,”
because it goes up spiritually, and like a pilgrim who
is out of his known country. In the fourth, I say
how the spirit sees her such (that is, in such quality)
that I cannot understand her; that is to say, my
thought rises into the quality of her in a degree that
my intellect cannot comprehend, seeing that our
intellect is, towards those blessed souls, like our eye</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span><i>weak against the sun; and this the Philosopher says
in the Second of the Metaphysics. In the fifth, I say
that, although I cannot see there whither my thought
carries me—that is, to her admirable essence—I at
least understand this, namely, that it is a thought
of my lady, because I often hear her name therein.
And, at the end of this fifth part, I say, “Ladies
mine,” to show that they are ladies to whom I speak.
The second part begins, “A new perception;” the
third, “When it hath reached;” the fourth, “It sees
her such;” the fifth, “And yet I know.” It might
be divided yet more nicely, and made yet clearer;
but this division may pass, and therefore I stay not
to divide it further.</i>

<div class="poem"><p>Beyond the sphere which spreads to widest space</p>
<p class="i2">  Now soars the sigh that my heart sends above:</p>
<p class="i2">  A new perception born of grieving Love</p>
<p>Guideth it upward the untrodden ways.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>When it hath reached unto the end, and stays,</p>
<p class="i2">  It sees a lady round whom splendours move</p>
<p class="i2">  In homage; till, by the great light thereof</p>

<p>It sees her such, that when it tells me this</p>
<p class="i2">  Which it hath seen, I understand it not,</p>
<p class="i4">    It hath a speech so subtile and so fine.</p>

<p>
After writing this sonnet, it was given unto me
to behold a very wonderful vision:<a class="tag" id="tag32" href="#note32">[32]</a> wherein I saw
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>things which determined me that I would say
nothing further of this most blessed one, until such
time as I could discourse more worthily concerning
her. And to this end I labour all I can; as she well
knoweth. Wherefore if it be His pleasure through
whom is the life of all things, that my life continue
with me a few years, it is my hope that I shall
yet write concerning her what hath not before been
written of any woman. After the which, may it
seem good unto Him who is the Master of Grace,
that my spirit should go hence to behold the glory
of its lady: to wit, of that blessed Beatrice who now
gazeth continually on His countenance <i>qui est per
omnia sæcula benedictus</i>.<a class="tag" id="tag33" href="#note33">[33]</a> <i>Laus Deo.</i>

<p class="pad2">
<a id="note1" href="#tag1">1.</a> <i>Gentile.</i> The word means “noble” rather than (in
its modern shade of meaning) “gentle.” “Genteel” would
sometimes apply, but has ceased to be admissible in
serious writing.

</p>

<p>
<a id="note3" href="#tag3">3.</a> I must hazard here (to relieve the first page of my
translation from a long note) a suggestion as to the meaning
of the most puzzling passage in the whole <i>Vita Nuova</i>,—that
sentence just at the outset which says, “La gloriosa
donna della mia mente, la quale fù chiamata da molti
Beatrice, i quali non sapeano che si chiamare.” On this
passage all the commentators seem helpless, turning it
about and sometimes adopting alterations not to be found
in any ancient manuscript of the work. The words mean
literally, “The glorious lady of my mind who was called
Beatrice by many who knew not how she was called.” This
presents the obvious difficulty that the lady’s name really
<i>was</i> Beatrice, and that Dante throughout uses that name
himself. In the text of my version I have adopted, as a
rendering, the one of the various compromises which seemed
to give the most beauty to the meaning. But it occurs to me
that a less irrational escape out of the difficulty than any I
have seen suggested may possibly be found by linking this
passage with the close of the sonnet at page 104 of the
<i>Vita Nuova</i>, beginning, “I felt a spirit of love begin to
stir,” in the last line of which sonnet Love is made to
assert that the name of Beatrice is <i>Love</i>. Dante appears to
have dwelt on this fancy with some pleasure, from what
is said in an earlier sonnet (page 39) about “Love in his
proper form” (by which Beatrice seems to be meant)
bending over a dead lady. And it is in connection with
the sonnet where the name of Beatrice is said to be Love,
that Dante, as if to show us that the Love he speaks of is
only his own emotion, enters into an argument as to Love
being merely an accident in substance,—in other words,
“Amore e il cor gentil son una cosa.” This conjecture may
be pronounced extravagant; but the <i>Vita Nuova</i>, when
examined, proves so full of intricate and fantastic analogies,
even in the mere arrangement of its parts, (much more than
appears on any but the closest scrutiny,) that it seems admissible
to suggest even a whimsical solution of a difficulty
which remains unconquered. Or to have recourse to the much
more welcome means of solution afforded by simple inherent
beauty: may not the meaning be merely that any person
looking on so noble and lovely a creation, without knowledge
of her name, must have spontaneously called her Beatrice,—<i>i.e.</i>,
the giver of blessing? This would be analogous by antithesis
to the translation I have adopted in my text.

meeting took place at a May Feast, given in the year 1274
by Folco Portinari, father of Beatrice, who ranked among the
principal citizens of Florence: to which feast Dante accompanied
his father, Alighiero Alighieri.

<a id="note13" href="#tag13">13.</a> <i>i.e.</i>, in a church.
</p>

<p>
<a id="note14" href="#tag14">14.</a> It will be observed that this poem is not what we now
call a sonnet. Its structure, however, is analogous to that
of the sonnet, being two sextetts followed by two quatrains,
instead of two quatrains followed by two triplets. Dante
applies the term sonnet to both these forms of composition,
and to no other.
</p>

<p>
<a id="note15" href="#tag15">15.</a> The commentators assert that the last two lines here do
not allude to the dead lady, but to Beatrice. This would
make the poem very clumsy in construction; yet there must
be some covert allusion to Beatrice, as Dante himself intimates.
The only form in which I can trace it consists in the implied
assertion that such person as <i>had</i> enjoyed the dead lady’s
society was worthy of heaven, and that person was Beatrice.
Or indeed the allusion to Beatrice might be in the first poem,
where he says that Love “<i>in forma vera</i>” (that is, Beatrice),
mourned over the corpse: as he afterwards says of Beatrice,
“<i>Quella ha nome Amor</i>.” Most probably <i>both</i> allusions are
intended.
</p>

<p>
<a id="note16" href="#tag16">16.</a> “My son, it is time for us to lay aside our counterfeiting.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="note17" href="#tag17">17.</a> “I am as the centre of a circle, to the which all parts
of the circumference bear an equal relation: but with thee
it is not thus.” This phrase seems to have remained as
obscure to commentators as Dante found it at the moment.
No one, as far as I know, has even fairly tried to find a meaning
for it. To me the following appears a not unlikely one.
Love is weeping on Dante’s account, and not on his own.
He says, “I am the centre of a circle (<i>Amor che muove il
sole e l’altre stelle</i>): therefore all lovable objects, whether
in heaven or earth, or any part of the circle’s circumference,
are equally near to me. Not so thou, who wilt one day lose
Beatrice when she goes to heaven.” The phrase would thus
contain an intimation of the death of Beatrice, accounting
for Dante being next told not to inquire the meaning
of the speech,—”Demand no more than may be useful to
thee.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="note18" href="#tag18">18.</a> “Names are the consequents of things.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="note19" href="#tag19">19.</a> It is difficult not to connect Dante’s agony at this wedding-feast
with our knowledge that in her twenty-first year Beatrice
was wedded to Simone de’ Bardi. That she herself was the
bride on this occasion might seem out of the question, from
the fact of its not being in any way so stated: but on the
other hand, Dante’s silence throughout the <i>Vita Nuova</i> as
regards her marriage (which must have brought deep sorrow
even to his ideal love) is so startling, that we might almost
be led to conceive in this passage the only intimation of it
which he thought fit to give.
</p>

<p>
<a id="note20" href="#tag20">20.</a> Guido Guinicelli, in the canzone which begins, “Within
the gentle heart Love shelters him.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="note21" href="#tag21">21.</a> There is a play in the original upon the words <i>Primavera</i>
(Spring) and <i>prima verrà</i> (she shall come first), to which I
have given as near an equivalent as I could.
</p>

<p>
<a id="note22" href="#tag22">22.</a> “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare
ye the way of the Lord.’”
</p>

<p>
<a id="note23" href="#tag23">23.</a> That is (as I understand it), suppressing, from delicacy
towards his friend, the words in which Love describes Joan
as merely the forerunner of Beatrice. And perhaps in the
latter part of this sentence a reproach is gently conveyed to
the fickle Guido Cavalcanti, who may already have transferred
his homage (though Dante had not then learned it)
from Joan to Mandetta.
</p>

<p>
<a id="note24" href="#tag24">24.</a> On reading Dante’s treatise <i>De Vulgari Eloquio</i>, it will
be found that the distinction which he intends here is not
between one language, or dialect, and another; but between
“vulgar speech” (that is, the language handed down from
mother to son without any conscious use of grammar or
syntax), and language as regulated by grammarians and the
laws of literary composition, and which Dante calls simply
“Grammar.” A great deal might be said on the bearings
of the present passage, but it is no part of my plan to enter
on such questions.
</p>

<p>
<a id="note25" href="#tag25">25.</a> <i>i.e.</i>, the languages of Provence and Tuscany.
</p>

<p>
<a id="note26" href="#tag26">26.</a> It strikes me that this curious passage furnishes a reason,
hitherto (I believe) overlooked, why Dante put such of his
lyrical poems as relate to philosophy into the form of love-poems.
He liked writing in Italian rhyme rather than Latin
metre; he thought Italian rhyme ought to be confined to
love-poems: therefore whatever he wrote (at this age) had
to take the form of a love-poem. Thus any poem by Dante
not concerning love is later than his twenty-seventh year
(1291-2), when he wrote the prose of the <i>Vita Nuova</i>; the
poetry having been written earlier, at the time of the events
referred to.
</p>

<p>
<a id="note27" href="#tag27">27.</a> “How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people!
how is she become as a widow, she that was great among
the nations!”—<i>Lamentations of Jeremiah</i>, i. I.
</p>

<p>
<a id="note28" href="#tag28">28.</a> Beatrice Portinari will thus be found to have died during
the first hour of the 9th of June, 1290. And from what
Dante says at the commencement of this work, (viz., that she
was younger than himself by eight or nine months,) it may
also be gathered that her age, at the time of her death, was
twenty-four years and three months. The “perfect number”
mentioned in the present passage is the number ten.
</p>

<p>
<a id="note29" href="#tag29">29.</a> Thus according to some texts. The majority, however,
add the words, “And therefore was I in thought:” but
the shorter speech is perhaps the more forcible and pathetic.
</p>

<p>
<a id="note30" href="#tag30">30.</a> Boccaccio tells us that Dante was married to Gemma
Donati about a year after the death of Beatrice. Can Gemma
then be “the lady of the window,” his love for whom Dante
so contemns? Such a passing conjecture (when considered
together with the interpretation of this passage in Dante’s
later work, the <i>Convito</i>) would of course imply an admission
of what I believe to lie at the heart of all true Dantesque
commentary; that is, the existence always of the actual events
even where the allegorical superstructure has been raised
by Dante himself.
</p>

<p>
<a id="note31" href="#tag31">31.</a> The Veronica (<i>Vera icon</i>, or true image); that is, the
napkin with which a woman was said to have wiped our
Saviour’s face on His way to the cross, and which miraculously
retained its likeness. Dante makes mention of it also in the
<i>Commedia</i> (Parad. xxxi. 103" (Paradiso, Canto 31, line 103))., where he says:—
</p>

<div class="poem"><p>“Qual è colui che forse di Croazia</p>
<p class="i2">  Viene a veder la Veronica nostra,</p>
<p>Che per l’antica fama non si sazia</p>
<p class="i2">  Ma dice nel pensier fin che si mostra:</p>
<p>Signor mio Gesù Cristo, Iddio verace,</p>
<p class="i2">  Or fu sì fatta la sembianza vostra?” etc.</p></div>

<p>
<a id="note32" href="#tag32">32.</a> This we may believe to have been the Vision of Hell,
Purgatory, and Paradise, which furnished the triple argument
of the <i>Divina Commedia</i>. The Latin words ending the
<i>Vita Nuova</i> are almost identical with those at the close of
the letter in which Dante, on concluding the <i>Paradise</i>, and
accomplishing the hope here expressed, dedicates his great
work to Can Grande della Scala.
